Orion can be accessed either directly through\nthe customerâs relationship with AWS or indirectly through  OpenEye . \n Orion is an open platform that allows for straightforward integration of third-party code (i.e., from customers, academics, and vendors). The Orion\nfront end is a webpage, deliverable on any internet-enabled supported platform. \n \n Supported Browsers Â¶ \n \n \n Orion supports the most recent stable desktop versions of MozillaÂ® FirefoxÂ® and Google Chromeâ¢. \n \n \n \n Hint \n Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), Microsoft Edge, and macOS Safari are not supported. \n \n \n \n Supported Platforms Â¶ \n \n \n Windows \n macOS \n Linux \n Chrome OS \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n \n Orion organization admins can view user spending by project and user. \n Orion organization admins can see all projects and jobs from all users. \n Orion organization admins can only see project names but not the data in the projects. \n Non-admins can only see their own projects and the projects shared with them. \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n \n On Orionâs home page, users can view information about: \n \n \n projects \n recent jobs \n system status \n expenses \n RSS feeds \n A new userâs default project is created when the new user is added to the system. \n Non-admin usersâ projects are listed on an admin userâs Home page. \n Duplicate project names are not allowed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n \n Each project has its own Summary page. From the Project Summary page, users can: \n \n \n edit or delete projects \n add notes, molecular structures, and files \n add or remove project members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n \n Usersâ datasets, collections, and files are displayed on the Project data page. \n Files can be uploaded to the  Project   Data  page and converted to datasets, while datasets can be downloaded in the usual molecular formats. \n Admin users can share files and datasets with the entire organization. \n Collections can be filtered by name. \n Datasets can be copied and/or duplicated. \n Users can share multiple datasets to a project or with multiple recipients in one operation. \n Users can add or remove data tags. \n Datasets can be viewed using Card View. \n Columns are sortable in Card View. \n Individual molecules can be selected from the Card View to send to a Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n \n The Analyze pageâs features include: \n \n \n a molecular spreadsheet \n graphing capabilitiesâscatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and violin plots \n 2D and 3D viewing \n molecule subset creation \n filtering and tagging \n cheminformatics functionsâsubstructure search, R-group decomposition, and property calculation \n \n \n \n Molecules can be sent directly to FastROCS from the Analyze page. \n Molecules can be sent directly to a Floe using the Send to Workfloe feature. \n Users can add comments and ratings for molecules in the Analyze page and the 3D Viewer. \n Conformer data can be displayed in the spreadsheet and plot. \n Receptors are by default designated as â3D Onlyâ datasets, to keep them out of property calculations and the Analyze page. \n Users can turn on binning on a per-column basis. \n \n \n \n \n Floe UI Â¶ \n \n \n Users can upload packages containing Cubes and Floes. \n Packages can be searched by name. \n Floes can be shared with other users. \n The Floe Editor allows users to build a new Floe or edit an existing Floe. \n Users can place Cubes in a Cube group. \n Cube groups can be deleted. \n Running jobs can be monitored graphically. \n Jobs can be filtered by project and user (admin-only functionality). \n Parameters can be marked as âhiddenâ by the Floe author. \n Initializer ports are colored blue to make them visually different from other port types. \n Archive files (i.e., tar and zip files) are importable. \n \n \n \n \n 3D Viewer Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer includes functionality for perceiving protein and ligand interactions as well as for editing facilities for ligands in the context of the active site. \n Users can convert molecules from 2D to 3D in the 3D Viewer. \n Keyboard navigation can be used to cycle through conformers. \n Users can send molecules from MMDS directly to the 3D Viewer. \n Surfaces can be Z-clipped independently of other 3D objects. \n \n \n \n \n Iterative Design Â¶ \n \n \n Iterative Design has functionality that allows users to generate new analogs of existing compounds. Users can edit molecules in 2D or 3D. Additionally, users can\nchoose from the following algorithms: \n \n \n Matched Molecular Pairs (MMP) \n Near Fragment Replacement (NPR) \n Reagent Join (RJ) \n Explore Sidechains (ES) \n \n \n \n Iterative Design and molecule builder tasks run on their own servers. \n Property plots handle multiple pages of data. \n If necessary, entry into an Iterative Design session can be cancelled by the user. \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n \n Two data services are available: \n \n \n MacroMolecular Data Service (MMDS), a protein structure repository \n FastROCS, a method for retrieving all similar structures by shape and color (aligned chemical groups) from a database \n \n \n \n Users can send molecules directly to Orion from either data service. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Collections, datasets, and raw data files are\naccessible here.  The data organization system implements familiar concepts of paths and folders\nto organize and access data in  Orion . \n The Programming Guide has additional technical details about data handling in Orion . \n \n Organizing and sharing data in folders Â¶ \n Users can organize the data according to the way they would like\nto share data among team members in a project. In addition, there are controlled data sharing\ncapabilities among members in the project. To achieve these objectives, the following main folders\nare available to users. \n \n My Data The data in this location are private and only\naccessible by the user. However, these data still can be shared by moving the data to a Shared\nSpace workspace. Data are put in My Data unless you specify otherwise in your upload. \n Only you can see the data until you share it to the Team or Shared folders. \n \n Team Data The data in this location are available to all project members. \n \n Shared Spaces The data in this location are available to the project members selected by the user. \n \n \n \n Orion provides automatic intraspection of files: hovering gives a depiction of the\nfirst structure if the file contains small molecules, or a protein schematic if amino acids\nare present. Selecting one or more datasets creates an active dataset. Active datasets are\ncarried forward to any feature domain (for example, moving to the Analyze page automatically\npopulates the spreadsheet). The  Project   Data  page also shows which filters are currently\napplied to the active data. \n \n Project Data Page Layout Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Add Data  button \n Allows users to add data by uploading files,  sketching , or importing a biomolecule. \n \n Search \n Allows users to search for collections, datasets, or files by name or tag. \n \n Show  drop-down \n Allows users to show any assortment of collections, datasets, and files. \n \n Sort by  drop-down \n Allows users sort by one of several options. \n \n Datasets Table \n Lists project datasets, sorted as specified by the  Sort   by:  drop-down. \n \n Trash Can \n Repository for deleted datasets. To restore the dataset, click on the Trash Can, select the dataset, and drag it to the\nappropriate folder. \n \n \n \n \n Tile View Â¶ \n Another form of intraspection is available for small molecule files: the tile view. Activate the tile view by\nclicking the   icon to the left of a dataset name.\nOn completion of the browsing of structures, click  Cancel , and you will be returned to the originating page. \n \n The tile view displays a panel list of structures in 2D or 3D, with associated\nproperties. It can be configured to display single structures, a side-by-side view, a grid compare view, or a grid view.\nEntries can be sorted by properties selected from all those available within the dataset.\nThe tile view is designed for fast traversal; selected structures can form the basis of a selected set on leaving\nthe page. \n \n \n What actions do I need to take if I had an account on a pre-2021 version of Orion? Â¶ \n If you have a pre-2021  Orion  account, you\nwill need to take some action on the shared data from previous  Orion  versions. \n \n Decide how to organize the data. \n Move all previously shared items into the appropriate folders. \n Assign collections to a project. \n \n \n AWS Representation \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can. Anything in the\nTrash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. \n In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ\noption. Please consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n \n Searching for data Â¶ \n You can search for datasets by entering a tag or resource name in the search\nbar. Select the main folder or space you would like to search. Next, enter the tag\nor resource name and click on that name. Then, the results will be shown at the bottom\nof the page. In addition, you will be able to see the path where this data can be\nfound. \n \n \n Uploading data Â¶ \n You can specify a path when uploading a file into  Orion . To specify a path,\nselect the folder or subfolders as applicable. Alternatively, you can go up a\ndirectory by clicking on the up arrow or using the backspace key.\nAlso, you can create a new subfolder by entering the name and then\nclicking on  Create   a   new   folder . \n \n CXSMILES Data Â¶ \n Data can be uploaded in CXSMILES format. (Data/My Data/+Add Data/Uploadâ¦.) \n \n \n \n Downloading and Exporting Data Â¶ \n You can download data, and it will be converted to a canonical format if necessary. \n \n Select dataset > More Actions > Export. \n In the Export pop-up, choose your preferred file format, then click Export. \n In the notification panel, you can check the status of your exports. \n After download, optionally move or delete the exported file from My Data Exports. \n \n \n \n Deleting data Â¶ \n To delete data, first select the data you want to delete\nby clicking on the square box on the left side to the folder or subfolder name.\nNext, click the   icon on the far right or in the top menu.\nMultiple data can be selected and deleted at once. Then, these data will be\nmoved to the  Trash  space. The items in the trash will be automatically deleted after\n30 days. \n \n \n Preserving Data of a Removed User Â¶ \n Customers can open a support request to remove a user from an organization, which\ntransfers ownership of that userâs data to project owners or an organization administrator. \n \n \n Subfolders Â¶ \n To create a new subfolder, first select the place\n( My   Data ,  Team   Data  or  Shared   Spaces ) where you want to create a new subfolder.\nThen, click on the   icon next to the path (example:\nMy Data). In the pop-up window, enter the\nfolder name and click  OK . A new subfolder will be created\nwith the specified name in the selected path. \n You can create a new folder or subfolder in the same window you use to\nupload data or when starting a floe run. To do this,\nselect the path and then enter the name of the\nsubfolder you want to create. A green bar\nwill appear with  Create   a   new   folder  next to the\nsubfolder name you just entered. Click on  Create   a \n new   folder . A new folder or subfolder will show up\non the path specified. \n \n Favorite subfolders Â¶ \n To quickly access a subfolder, you can mark it as a favorite by clicking\non the  star  next to the folder, and it will be added to the  Favorite   Folders  area in the left side column. \n \n \n Deleting subfolders Â¶ \n To delete a subfolder, select the subfolder you want to\ndelete and click on the   icon. The subfolder and all the contents in this\nsubfolder will be moved to the Trash space. The items in the trash will be automatically\ndeleted after 30 days. \n \n \n Moving a subfolder Â¶ \n A subfolder can be moved to another path or location. To do this, select the folder you\nwould like to move, and click either the bi-directional line icon on top or the ellipsis\nicon, and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path and click the  Move  button.\nThe subfolder (and its contents) will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n \n Video tutorial about project data Â¶ \n For more information on the use of the project data\nfacilities,  see the tutorial video . \n \n Note \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can.\nAnything in the Trash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ option.\nPlease consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n Moving data between projects Â¶ \n Data (datasets, files and collections) can be moved between projects, folders or subfolders.\nTo do this, select the data you would like to move and click the bi-directional line icon or\nthe ellipsis ( ... ) icon and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path, and click\nthe  Move  button. The selected data will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n Collection Metadata Â¶ \n Some collections feature an information icon ( ) that displays pregenerated metadata about the collection. The\ninformation may be helpful in working with collections, because you can see the metadata immediately, without having\nto run a floe. \n \n \n \n \n \n Discussion boards Â¶ \n You often need not only to share data with team members but also to discuss the results\nwith them. \n Discussion boards are accessed by the âchatâ icon ( ) on the  Project   Data  page. If you select the\nicon, you get a display on the right side of the screen that will be familiar from\nother chat experiences you have used. \n You can share links and images along with text comments, and discussions are preserved\nso you can revisit them.  The discussion board  autosaves usersâ edits. \n For an introduction, see this training video: Introducing Discussion Boards \n You can see further information in this training video: Using Discussion Boards . \n \n \n Shared spaces Â¶ \n To share data, use the  Shared   Spaces  main folder (or space). \n You can start by creating a workspace in  Shared   Spaces . Click on the  +  icon\nnext to the path. A pop-up window named  Workspace   name  will appear. Enter the\nname of the workspace you want to create and click  OK . \n A new subfolder with the\nspecified name will show in the Shared Spaces. If you click on this workspace,\nthen you will have the option to add members with whom you want to share the data. \n Click on the   icon and then click on  Edit   Users . Enter the name of the\nuser/project member you want to add. In this window, you will have the option\nto set the permissions (write, delete) you want for that user to have.  All the\ndata in this workspace will be shared with the selected users/project members. \n Alternatively, if you would like all project members to have access to the data,\nsave the data in the  Team   Data  space. \n The items ( workspaces ) in  Shared   Spaces  resemble folders, but they are actually file systems in their own right.  The user interface\nenforces the differences between workspaces and folders. \n \n Note \n With folders, access to data by others is determined by the folder you choose to use.  For example, things in the  Team   Data  folder\nare accessible to all members of the project team. For the workspaces within  Shared   Spaces , you can define a subset of users who have access to the workspace\nand its data.  You can pick the users by use of the   icon. \n \n \n Move, Drag-and-Drop The user interface does not show these actions for workspaces in the list of workspaces because they cannot be performed. \n \n Create and Rename and Delete You can perform these actions on workspaces. \n \n Inside a workspace Folders created within a workspace behave as other folders do. \n \n \n \n \n Workspace with contents Â¶ \n \n \n \n List of workspaces Â¶ \n \n \n \n Organization Data Page Â¶ \n \n \n Data available to an organization Â¶ \n \n The  Organization   Data  space allows for\nadmin users to share datasets and collections with the entire organization. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

You can find links\nto them in this section and in relevant places elsewhere in this manual.  For a list of all tutorial videos,\nsee  Orion Video Tutorials . \n \n Data organization video Â¶ \n The features for organizing data have been revamped significantly.  For an introduction, try\nthis video:\n Data Organization in Orion . \n \n \n Discussion board videos Â¶ \n Discussion boards are a new user interface feature introduced in this version, accessed\nvia an icon on the  Project   Data  page:\n Introducing Discussion Boards \n We welcome your feedback on discussion boards after you have used them:\n Using Discussion Boards . \n For more about discussion boards, see  Discussion boards . \n \n \n 3D modeling videos Â¶ \n There are new badge and list features on the  3D   Modeling  page.\nHere is an introduction:  Badges and Lists in Orion . \n There are several more new videos about 3D modeling at  Orion Video Tutorials . \n \n \n \n Highlights Â¶ \n \n \n This release introduces a revamped  Project   Data  page which now uses a path- and folder-based file system for data organization. \n A desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders, or launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections as part of data migration. \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the  Home  page when users first login to Orion. \n Many enhancements have been made to  3D   Modeling  page, including several new tools for protein editing. \n Molecules, proteins, and other components of a dataset can now be identified using badges. \n Tooltips in the  3D   Viewer  have been enhanced. \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n A new discussion board Beta  feature is now available. \n This release introduces Orion stack protection through rate-limiting. \n Job cost email alerts can now be created. \n A dedicated  Organization   Data  project has been added. The data in this project are available to all Organization users and are prepopulated with\nOpenEye Data such as Collections used for virtual screening. \n New Floes have been added to  Floe  packages including: \n \n \n Non-Equilibrium Switching (NES) Floes in the MD Floe package. \n Cluster Poses, FastROCS,  and FreeForm Pose Floes in the Large-Scale-Floes package. \n Large-Scale Reaction Enumeration Floes in the Generative Design Floe package. \n \n \n \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types. \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Orion stack protection through rate-limiting has been implemented. \n Job cost email alerts are now available. Organization admins can set Job cost limits alerts for the entire organization on the Profile page. In addition, users can set\nJob cost limits alerts and Job termination thresholds for their own jobs on the Profile page. Job cost alerts can also be set prior to running a job on the Job Form.\nThese cost thresholds can be updated while a Job is running on the Job Status page. \n This release introduces a new Discussion Board Beta . Saved discussions may contain notes, images, or snapshot links of the 3D Modeling or Analyze pages.\nDiscussions are accessible to all team members. \n Substructure searching is now accessible from the databar filters. This functionality was previously available only on the Analyze page. \n Cubes which are being throttled now show up with special coloring. \n More information has been added to Job Debugging Data. \n A new instance-draining state has been added, which allows jobs to continue running but prevents new jobs from using the instance. \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types.\nFor new data being written to a dataset, it will be cast/coerced/promoted to the type of the existing dataset field. This matches what drconvert does.\nWhen writing records, if an incompatible type of data for a given field name is seen, the writer generates a new alternate field and stores the data in\nan alternate field rather than failing the writing process. \n \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the Home page when users first login to Orion. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A dedicated Organization Data project has been added. Data in this project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. In addition, the\nOrganization Data project is pre-populated with OpenEye-supplied data such as the Brood database, OpenEye-prepared third-party vendor collections for virtual screening,\ntutorial datasets, and other data that can be used as input to some of the included Orion Floes.  Note : The Organization Data project is only visible to Organization\nadmins in the list of projects in the Navbar and Home page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Organization admins now have control over the listing of projects on the Home page and Navbar on the Project Summary page. Organization admins can now toggle between\nâShow Allâ Organization projects and âShow Ownâ projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The Project Data page has been overhauled and now uses a folder-based file system for organizing your data, instead of a flat view. \n Within a project, data are organized into three main areas: \n \n \n My Data â your private data. No other users have access to this data. \n Team Data â data that are available to all project members. \n Shared Spaces â data that are available to select project members, i.e. shared data among the selected project members. \n \n \n \n New folders can be created from the Project Data page, when uploading data, and when launching a Floe from the Job Form. \n A dedicated Organization Data project is available to everyone in the Organization and is located above the Project Data folder hierarchy. Data in\nthis project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. \n The path to a desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders or when launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Folders and subfolders can be added to the  Favorite   Folders  space for quick and easy access. \n Data are now shared by creating a workspace in the âShared Foldersâ main folder. Permissions can be set for each user added to the workspace. \n Drag and drop functionality allows users to move collections, datasets, and/or files to the three main data areas, Trash can or other subfolders. \n String Search will search within the current folder or all project folders, i.e.,  My Data,  Team Data or Shared Spaces. \n Discussion boards Beta  can be created within a workspace to highlight and annotate data within that workspace, and can be viewed by all of that workspaceâs members. \n As part of the data migration, users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections. Collections now belong to projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n 3D Modeling Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer list is now record-focused. \n Badges to identify molecules, proteins and other components of datasets have been added to the 3D Viewer list. \n Tools for protein editing, including protonation state modification, capping terminal residues, and residue mutation have been added. \n When mutating protein residues, multiple residues can be selected and users can walk through applying a mutation to each residue in the selected set. \n Most of the small molecule editing tools can now be applied to proteins as well. \n The 3D molecule editor now contains the same set of molecular fragment templates as the 2D sketcher. \n An edited protein can be saved as a new dataset. \n A new receptor in OEDesignUnit (DU) display has been added. \n OEDesignUnit components can be edited and saved in place. \n Receptor ligands can be edited but not in place. Users need to make a copy of the ligand before editing.  Note : Receptor proteins cannot be edited. \n More options to save edited small molecules are now available. \n Users can edit datasets they donât own in place but need to save them to new datasets. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\n Project   Data  page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to the small molecule editing tools. \n Depiction tooltips in the list appear more reliably. \n \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to Data Handling. Users can now set the visibility for each column for each component of the user interface from the Data Handling dialog. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\nProject Data page. \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Spreadsheet fields now render correctly when users scroll to the right side of the spreadsheet. \n Layout issues when using multiple plots in trellis mode have been fixed. \n Molecules can now be sent to a Floe that takes a molecule fragment as input, for example, the Brood Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Selecting conformer points in the Scatter plot no longer fails intermittently. \n Saved color settings now persist. \n \n \n \n \n \n Floe User Interface Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n Support for a Job output folder path has been added to the Job Form. The default folder for Job output is âMy Dataâ, however, users can select\na different folder or create a new one. \n Job Cost alert and termination thresholds can now be set on the Job Form. The default values are inherited from the âMy Job Cost Limitsâ set\non the usersâ Profile page. Job Cost thresholds for any given job can be disabled by clearing the current value or setting the value to zero.\nThe values of these thresholds can be adjusted on the Job Status page after a job has been launched. \n Cubes in a running job are now colored specially when they are being throttled. More details are available in the Floe help. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n A bug has been fixed that caused Job parameters for jobs launched from the Orion command line interface (OCLI) from being displayed on the Job Status page. \n A bug that prevented the Job Form from opening for certain Floes has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n An issue that sometimes caused duplicate input or output parameters to appear in the Job Form has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Minor internal improvements have been made to  FastROCS ,  MaaS , and  MMDS . \n \n \n \n \n \n Admin Mode Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Options to customize Job Cost email alerts for Organization admins have been added. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Collections, datasets, and raw data files are\naccessible here.  The data organization system implements familiar concepts of paths and folders\nto organize and access data in  Orion . \n The Programming Guide has additional technical details about data handling in Orion . \n \n Organizing and sharing data in folders Â¶ \n Users can organize the data according to the way they would like\nto share data among team members in a project. In addition, there are controlled data sharing\ncapabilities among members in the project. To achieve these objectives, the following main folders\nare available to users. \n \n My Data The data in this location are private and only\naccessible by the user. However, these data still can be shared by moving the data to a Shared\nSpace workspace. Data are put in My Data unless you specify otherwise in your upload. \n Only you can see the data until you share it to the Team or Shared folders. \n \n Team Data The data in this location are available to all project members. \n \n Shared Spaces The data in this location are available to the project members selected by the user. \n \n \n \n Orion provides automatic intraspection of files: hovering gives a depiction of the\nfirst structure if the file contains small molecules, or a protein schematic if amino acids\nare present. Selecting one or more datasets creates an active dataset. Active datasets are\ncarried forward to any feature domain (for example, moving to the Analyze page automatically\npopulates the spreadsheet). The  Project   Data  page also shows which filters are currently\napplied to the active data. \n \n Project Data Page Layout Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Add Data  button \n Allows users to add data by uploading files,  sketching , or importing a biomolecule. \n \n Search \n Allows users to search for collections, datasets, or files by name or tag. \n \n Show  drop-down \n Allows users to show any assortment of collections, datasets, and files. \n \n Sort by  drop-down \n Allows users sort by one of several options. \n \n Datasets Table \n Lists project datasets, sorted as specified by the  Sort   by:  drop-down. \n \n Trash Can \n Repository for deleted datasets. To restore the dataset, click on the Trash Can, select the dataset, and drag it to the\nappropriate folder. \n \n \n \n \n Tile View Â¶ \n Another form of intraspection is available for small molecule files: the tile view. Activate the tile view by\nclicking the   icon to the left of a dataset name.\nOn completion of the browsing of structures, click  Cancel , and you will be returned to the originating page. \n \n The tile view displays a panel list of structures in 2D or 3D, with associated\nproperties. It can be configured to display single structures, a side-by-side view, a grid compare view, or a grid view.\nEntries can be sorted by properties selected from all those available within the dataset.\nThe tile view is designed for fast traversal; selected structures can form the basis of a selected set on leaving\nthe page. \n \n \n What actions do I need to take if I had an account on a pre-2021 version of Orion? Â¶ \n If you have a pre-2021  Orion  account, you\nwill need to take some action on the shared data from previous  Orion  versions. \n \n Decide how to organize the data. \n Move all previously shared items into the appropriate folders. \n Assign collections to a project. \n \n \n AWS Representation \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can. Anything in the\nTrash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. \n In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ\noption. Please consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n \n Searching for data Â¶ \n You can search for datasets by entering a tag or resource name in the search\nbar. Select the main folder or space you would like to search. Next, enter the tag\nor resource name and click on that name. Then, the results will be shown at the bottom\nof the page. In addition, you will be able to see the path where this data can be\nfound. \n \n \n Uploading data Â¶ \n You can specify a path when uploading a file into  Orion . To specify a path,\nselect the folder or subfolders as applicable. Alternatively, you can go up a\ndirectory by clicking on the up arrow or using the backspace key.\nAlso, you can create a new subfolder by entering the name and then\nclicking on  Create   a   new   folder . \n \n CXSMILES Data Â¶ \n Data can be uploaded in CXSMILES format. (Data/My Data/+Add Data/Uploadâ¦.) \n \n \n \n Downloading and Exporting Data Â¶ \n You can download data, and it will be converted to a canonical format if necessary. \n \n Select dataset > More Actions > Export. \n In the Export pop-up, choose your preferred file format, then click Export. \n In the notification panel, you can check the status of your exports. \n After download, optionally move or delete the exported file from My Data Exports. \n \n \n \n Deleting data Â¶ \n To delete data, first select the data you want to delete\nby clicking on the square box on the left side to the folder or subfolder name.\nNext, click the   icon on the far right or in the top menu.\nMultiple data can be selected and deleted at once. Then, these data will be\nmoved to the  Trash  space. The items in the trash will be automatically deleted after\n30 days. \n \n \n Preserving Data of a Removed User Â¶ \n Customers can open a support request to remove a user from an organization, which\ntransfers ownership of that userâs data to project owners or an organization administrator. \n \n \n Subfolders Â¶ \n To create a new subfolder, first select the place\n( My   Data ,  Team   Data  or  Shared   Spaces ) where you want to create a new subfolder.\nThen, click on the   icon next to the path (example:\nMy Data). In the pop-up window, enter the\nfolder name and click  OK . A new subfolder will be created\nwith the specified name in the selected path. \n You can create a new folder or subfolder in the same window you use to\nupload data or when starting a floe run. To do this,\nselect the path and then enter the name of the\nsubfolder you want to create. A green bar\nwill appear with  Create   a   new   folder  next to the\nsubfolder name you just entered. Click on  Create   a \n new   folder . A new folder or subfolder will show up\non the path specified. \n \n Favorite subfolders Â¶ \n To quickly access a subfolder, you can mark it as a favorite by clicking\non the  star  next to the folder, and it will be added to the  Favorite   Folders  area in the left side column. \n \n \n Deleting subfolders Â¶ \n To delete a subfolder, select the subfolder you want to\ndelete and click on the   icon. The subfolder and all the contents in this\nsubfolder will be moved to the Trash space. The items in the trash will be automatically\ndeleted after 30 days. \n \n \n Moving a subfolder Â¶ \n A subfolder can be moved to another path or location. To do this, select the folder you\nwould like to move, and click either the bi-directional line icon on top or the ellipsis\nicon, and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path and click the  Move  button.\nThe subfolder (and its contents) will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n \n Video tutorial about project data Â¶ \n For more information on the use of the project data\nfacilities,  see the tutorial video . \n \n Note \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can.\nAnything in the Trash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ option.\nPlease consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n Moving data between projects Â¶ \n Data (datasets, files and collections) can be moved between projects, folders or subfolders.\nTo do this, select the data you would like to move and click the bi-directional line icon or\nthe ellipsis ( ... ) icon and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path, and click\nthe  Move  button. The selected data will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n Collection Metadata Â¶ \n Some collections feature an information icon ( ) that displays pregenerated metadata about the collection. The\ninformation may be helpful in working with collections, because you can see the metadata immediately, without having\nto run a floe. \n \n \n \n \n \n Discussion boards Â¶ \n You often need not only to share data with team members but also to discuss the results\nwith them. \n Discussion boards are accessed by the âchatâ icon ( ) on the  Project   Data  page. If you select the\nicon, you get a display on the right side of the screen that will be familiar from\nother chat experiences you have used. \n You can share links and images along with text comments, and discussions are preserved\nso you can revisit them.  The discussion board  autosaves usersâ edits. \n For an introduction, see this training video: Introducing Discussion Boards \n You can see further information in this training video: Using Discussion Boards . \n \n \n Shared spaces Â¶ \n To share data, use the  Shared   Spaces  main folder (or space). \n You can start by creating a workspace in  Shared   Spaces . Click on the  +  icon\nnext to the path. A pop-up window named  Workspace   name  will appear. Enter the\nname of the workspace you want to create and click  OK . \n A new subfolder with the\nspecified name will show in the Shared Spaces. If you click on this workspace,\nthen you will have the option to add members with whom you want to share the data. \n Click on the   icon and then click on  Edit   Users . Enter the name of the\nuser/project member you want to add. In this window, you will have the option\nto set the permissions (write, delete) you want for that user to have.  All the\ndata in this workspace will be shared with the selected users/project members. \n Alternatively, if you would like all project members to have access to the data,\nsave the data in the  Team   Data  space. \n The items ( workspaces ) in  Shared   Spaces  resemble folders, but they are actually file systems in their own right.  The user interface\nenforces the differences between workspaces and folders. \n \n Note \n With folders, access to data by others is determined by the folder you choose to use.  For example, things in the  Team   Data  folder\nare accessible to all members of the project team. For the workspaces within  Shared   Spaces , you can define a subset of users who have access to the workspace\nand its data.  You can pick the users by use of the   icon. \n \n \n Move, Drag-and-Drop The user interface does not show these actions for workspaces in the list of workspaces because they cannot be performed. \n \n Create and Rename and Delete You can perform these actions on workspaces. \n \n Inside a workspace Folders created within a workspace behave as other folders do. \n \n \n \n \n Workspace with contents Â¶ \n \n \n \n List of workspaces Â¶ \n \n \n \n Organization Data Page Â¶ \n \n \n Data available to an organization Â¶ \n \n The  Organization   Data  space allows for\nadmin users to share datasets and collections with the entire organization. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

These options are enabled by using the corresponding checkboxes. Contours can be adjusted with a slide bar. When\nadding a new constraint, you can adjust the interaction options using the toolbar on the\nright-hand side of the 3D Viewer. Click the plus sign to bring up the âAdd a Constraintâ box. As you\nhover over the binding site, circles will appear that correspond to atoms in your protein.\nTo add a new constraint, either select one of these atoms or choose the âCustomâ option to add a SMARTS pattern. Click the disk\nicon to save the DU. \n \n \n Adding a new constraint Â¶ \n \n You can also add a new receptor to a DU if the DU does not have a receptor. The option to add a receptor will  only  appear\nif there is no receptor present. Most of the time, this step is not necessary. \n \n \n Protein editing video Â¶ \n For a tutorial on protein editing, see\n Protein Editing: 3D Modeling . \n \n \n Receptor constraints video Â¶ \n Features for enabling and modifying constraints are covered in the  2023.1 video . \n \n \n Styling small molecules video Â¶ \n For a tutorial about how to visualize small molecules, see\n Styling Small Molecules . \n \n \n More tutorial videos Â¶ \n For more training videos on 3D features, see the  3D Features Video Tutorials . \n \n Hint \n Selected objects are listed in the Visible Objects sublist at the top of the parent Active Objects list. Selecting any or all objects from\nthis list places them in the Selected bucket list. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Collections, datasets, and raw data files are\naccessible here.  The data organization system implements familiar concepts of paths and folders\nto organize and access data in  Orion . \n The Programming Guide has additional technical details about data handling in Orion . \n \n Organizing and sharing data in folders Â¶ \n Users can organize the data according to the way they would like\nto share data among team members in a project. In addition, there are controlled data sharing\ncapabilities among members in the project. To achieve these objectives, the following main folders\nare available to users. \n \n My Data The data in this location are private and only\naccessible by the user. However, these data still can be shared by moving the data to a Shared\nSpace workspace. Data are put in My Data unless you specify otherwise in your upload. \n Only you can see the data until you share it to the Team or Shared folders. \n \n Team Data The data in this location are available to all project members. \n \n Shared Spaces The data in this location are available to the project members selected by the user. \n \n \n \n Orion provides automatic intraspection of files: hovering gives a depiction of the\nfirst structure if the file contains small molecules, or a protein schematic if amino acids\nare present. Selecting one or more datasets creates an active dataset. Active datasets are\ncarried forward to any feature domain (for example, moving to the Analyze page automatically\npopulates the spreadsheet). The  Project   Data  page also shows which filters are currently\napplied to the active data. \n \n Project Data Page Layout Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Add Data  button \n Allows users to add data by uploading files,  sketching , or importing a biomolecule. \n \n Search \n Allows users to search for collections, datasets, or files by name or tag. \n \n Show  drop-down \n Allows users to show any assortment of collections, datasets, and files. \n \n Sort by  drop-down \n Allows users sort by one of several options. \n \n Datasets Table \n Lists project datasets, sorted as specified by the  Sort   by:  drop-down. \n \n Trash Can \n Repository for deleted datasets. To restore the dataset, click on the Trash Can, select the dataset, and drag it to the\nappropriate folder. \n \n \n \n \n Tile View Â¶ \n Another form of intraspection is available for small molecule files: the tile view. Activate the tile view by\nclicking the   icon to the left of a dataset name.\nOn completion of the browsing of structures, click  Cancel , and you will be returned to the originating page. \n \n The tile view displays a panel list of structures in 2D or 3D, with associated\nproperties. It can be configured to display single structures, a side-by-side view, a grid compare view, or a grid view.\nEntries can be sorted by properties selected from all those available within the dataset.\nThe tile view is designed for fast traversal; selected structures can form the basis of a selected set on leaving\nthe page. \n \n \n What actions do I need to take if I had an account on a pre-2021 version of Orion? Â¶ \n If you have a pre-2021  Orion  account, you\nwill need to take some action on the shared data from previous  Orion  versions. \n \n Decide how to organize the data. \n Move all previously shared items into the appropriate folders. \n Assign collections to a project. \n \n \n AWS Representation \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can. Anything in the\nTrash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. \n In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ\noption. Please consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n \n Searching for data Â¶ \n You can search for datasets by entering a tag or resource name in the search\nbar. Select the main folder or space you would like to search. Next, enter the tag\nor resource name and click on that name. Then, the results will be shown at the bottom\nof the page. In addition, you will be able to see the path where this data can be\nfound. \n \n \n Uploading data Â¶ \n You can specify a path when uploading a file into  Orion . To specify a path,\nselect the folder or subfolders as applicable. Alternatively, you can go up a\ndirectory by clicking on the up arrow or using the backspace key.\nAlso, you can create a new subfolder by entering the name and then\nclicking on  Create   a   new   folder . \n \n CXSMILES Data Â¶ \n Data can be uploaded in CXSMILES format. (Data/My Data/+Add Data/Uploadâ¦.) \n \n \n \n Downloading and Exporting Data Â¶ \n You can download data, and it will be converted to a canonical format if necessary. \n \n Select dataset > More Actions > Export. \n In the Export pop-up, choose your preferred file format, then click Export. \n In the notification panel, you can check the status of your exports. \n After download, optionally move or delete the exported file from My Data Exports. \n \n \n \n Deleting data Â¶ \n To delete data, first select the data you want to delete\nby clicking on the square box on the left side to the folder or subfolder name.\nNext, click the   icon on the far right or in the top menu.\nMultiple data can be selected and deleted at once. Then, these data will be\nmoved to the  Trash  space. The items in the trash will be automatically deleted after\n30 days. \n \n \n Preserving Data of a Removed User Â¶ \n Customers can open a support request to remove a user from an organization, which\ntransfers ownership of that userâs data to project owners or an organization administrator. \n \n \n Subfolders Â¶ \n To create a new subfolder, first select the place\n( My   Data ,  Team   Data  or  Shared   Spaces ) where you want to create a new subfolder.\nThen, click on the   icon next to the path (example:\nMy Data). In the pop-up window, enter the\nfolder name and click  OK . A new subfolder will be created\nwith the specified name in the selected path. \n You can create a new folder or subfolder in the same window you use to\nupload data or when starting a floe run. To do this,\nselect the path and then enter the name of the\nsubfolder you want to create. A green bar\nwill appear with  Create   a   new   folder  next to the\nsubfolder name you just entered. Click on  Create   a \n new   folder . A new folder or subfolder will show up\non the path specified. \n \n Favorite subfolders Â¶ \n To quickly access a subfolder, you can mark it as a favorite by clicking\non the  star  next to the folder, and it will be added to the  Favorite   Folders  area in the left side column. \n \n \n Deleting subfolders Â¶ \n To delete a subfolder, select the subfolder you want to\ndelete and click on the   icon. The subfolder and all the contents in this\nsubfolder will be moved to the Trash space. The items in the trash will be automatically\ndeleted after 30 days. \n \n \n Moving a subfolder Â¶ \n A subfolder can be moved to another path or location. To do this, select the folder you\nwould like to move, and click either the bi-directional line icon on top or the ellipsis\nicon, and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path and click the  Move  button.\nThe subfolder (and its contents) will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n \n Video tutorial about project data Â¶ \n For more information on the use of the project data\nfacilities,  see the tutorial video . \n \n Note \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can.\nAnything in the Trash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ option.\nPlease consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n Moving data between projects Â¶ \n Data (datasets, files and collections) can be moved between projects, folders or subfolders.\nTo do this, select the data you would like to move and click the bi-directional line icon or\nthe ellipsis ( ... ) icon and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path, and click\nthe  Move  button. The selected data will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n Collection Metadata Â¶ \n Some collections feature an information icon ( ) that displays pregenerated metadata about the collection. The\ninformation may be helpful in working with collections, because you can see the metadata immediately, without having\nto run a floe. \n \n \n \n \n \n Discussion boards Â¶ \n You often need not only to share data with team members but also to discuss the results\nwith them. \n Discussion boards are accessed by the âchatâ icon ( ) on the  Project   Data  page. If you select the\nicon, you get a display on the right side of the screen that will be familiar from\nother chat experiences you have used. \n You can share links and images along with text comments, and discussions are preserved\nso you can revisit them.  The discussion board  autosaves usersâ edits. \n For an introduction, see this training video: Introducing Discussion Boards \n You can see further information in this training video: Using Discussion Boards . \n \n \n Shared spaces Â¶ \n To share data, use the  Shared   Spaces  main folder (or space). \n You can start by creating a workspace in  Shared   Spaces . Click on the  +  icon\nnext to the path. A pop-up window named  Workspace   name  will appear. Enter the\nname of the workspace you want to create and click  OK . \n A new subfolder with the\nspecified name will show in the Shared Spaces. If you click on this workspace,\nthen you will have the option to add members with whom you want to share the data. \n Click on the   icon and then click on  Edit   Users . Enter the name of the\nuser/project member you want to add. In this window, you will have the option\nto set the permissions (write, delete) you want for that user to have.  All the\ndata in this workspace will be shared with the selected users/project members. \n Alternatively, if you would like all project members to have access to the data,\nsave the data in the  Team   Data  space. \n The items ( workspaces ) in  Shared   Spaces  resemble folders, but they are actually file systems in their own right.  The user interface\nenforces the differences between workspaces and folders. \n \n Note \n With folders, access to data by others is determined by the folder you choose to use.  For example, things in the  Team   Data  folder\nare accessible to all members of the project team. For the workspaces within  Shared   Spaces , you can define a subset of users who have access to the workspace\nand its data.  You can pick the users by use of the   icon. \n \n \n Move, Drag-and-Drop The user interface does not show these actions for workspaces in the list of workspaces because they cannot be performed. \n \n Create and Rename and Delete You can perform these actions on workspaces. \n \n Inside a workspace Folders created within a workspace behave as other folders do. \n \n \n \n \n Workspace with contents Â¶ \n \n \n \n List of workspaces Â¶ \n \n \n \n Organization Data Page Â¶ \n \n \n Data available to an organization Â¶ \n \n The  Organization   Data  space allows for\nadmin users to share datasets and collections with the entire organization. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Orion can be accessed either directly through\nthe customerâs relationship with AWS or indirectly through  OpenEye . \n Orion is an open platform that allows for straightforward integration of third-party code (i.e., from customers, academics, and vendors). The Orion\nfront end is a webpage, deliverable on any internet-enabled supported platform. \n \n Supported Browsers Â¶ \n \n \n Orion supports the most recent stable desktop versions of MozillaÂ® FirefoxÂ® and Google Chromeâ¢. \n \n \n \n Hint \n Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), Microsoft Edge, and macOS Safari are not supported. \n \n \n \n Supported Platforms Â¶ \n \n \n Windows \n macOS \n Linux \n Chrome OS \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n \n Orion organization admins can view user spending by project and user. \n Orion organization admins can see all projects and jobs from all users. \n Orion organization admins can only see project names but not the data in the projects. \n Non-admins can only see their own projects and the projects shared with them. \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n \n On Orionâs home page, users can view information about: \n \n \n projects \n recent jobs \n system status \n expenses \n RSS feeds \n A new userâs default project is created when the new user is added to the system. \n Non-admin usersâ projects are listed on an admin userâs Home page. \n Duplicate project names are not allowed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n \n Each project has its own Summary page. From the Project Summary page, users can: \n \n \n edit or delete projects \n add notes, molecular structures, and files \n add or remove project members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n \n Usersâ datasets, collections, and files are displayed on the Project data page. \n Files can be uploaded to the  Project   Data  page and converted to datasets, while datasets can be downloaded in the usual molecular formats. \n Admin users can share files and datasets with the entire organization. \n Collections can be filtered by name. \n Datasets can be copied and/or duplicated. \n Users can share multiple datasets to a project or with multiple recipients in one operation. \n Users can add or remove data tags. \n Datasets can be viewed using Card View. \n Columns are sortable in Card View. \n Individual molecules can be selected from the Card View to send to a Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n \n The Analyze pageâs features include: \n \n \n a molecular spreadsheet \n graphing capabilitiesâscatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and violin plots \n 2D and 3D viewing \n molecule subset creation \n filtering and tagging \n cheminformatics functionsâsubstructure search, R-group decomposition, and property calculation \n \n \n \n Molecules can be sent directly to FastROCS from the Analyze page. \n Molecules can be sent directly to a Floe using the Send to Workfloe feature. \n Users can add comments and ratings for molecules in the Analyze page and the 3D Viewer. \n Conformer data can be displayed in the spreadsheet and plot. \n Receptors are by default designated as â3D Onlyâ datasets, to keep them out of property calculations and the Analyze page. \n Users can turn on binning on a per-column basis. \n \n \n \n \n Floe UI Â¶ \n \n \n Users can upload packages containing Cubes and Floes. \n Packages can be searched by name. \n Floes can be shared with other users. \n The Floe Editor allows users to build a new Floe or edit an existing Floe. \n Users can place Cubes in a Cube group. \n Cube groups can be deleted. \n Running jobs can be monitored graphically. \n Jobs can be filtered by project and user (admin-only functionality). \n Parameters can be marked as âhiddenâ by the Floe author. \n Initializer ports are colored blue to make them visually different from other port types. \n Archive files (i.e., tar and zip files) are importable. \n \n \n \n \n 3D Viewer Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer includes functionality for perceiving protein and ligand interactions as well as for editing facilities for ligands in the context of the active site. \n Users can convert molecules from 2D to 3D in the 3D Viewer. \n Keyboard navigation can be used to cycle through conformers. \n Users can send molecules from MMDS directly to the 3D Viewer. \n Surfaces can be Z-clipped independently of other 3D objects. \n \n \n \n \n Iterative Design Â¶ \n \n \n Iterative Design has functionality that allows users to generate new analogs of existing compounds. Users can edit molecules in 2D or 3D. Additionally, users can\nchoose from the following algorithms: \n \n \n Matched Molecular Pairs (MMP) \n Near Fragment Replacement (NPR) \n Reagent Join (RJ) \n Explore Sidechains (ES) \n \n \n \n Iterative Design and molecule builder tasks run on their own servers. \n Property plots handle multiple pages of data. \n If necessary, entry into an Iterative Design session can be cancelled by the user. \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n \n Two data services are available: \n \n \n MacroMolecular Data Service (MMDS), a protein structure repository \n FastROCS, a method for retrieving all similar structures by shape and color (aligned chemical groups) from a database \n \n \n \n Users can send molecules directly to Orion from either data service. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Orion can be accessed either directly through\nthe customerâs relationship with AWS or indirectly through  OpenEye . \n Orion is an open platform that allows for straightforward integration of third-party code (i.e., from customers, academics, and vendors). The Orion\nfront end is a webpage, deliverable on any internet-enabled supported platform. \n \n Supported Browsers Â¶ \n \n \n Orion supports the most recent stable desktop versions of MozillaÂ® FirefoxÂ® and Google Chromeâ¢. \n \n \n \n Hint \n Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), Microsoft Edge, and macOS Safari are not supported. \n \n \n \n Supported Platforms Â¶ \n \n \n Windows \n macOS \n Linux \n Chrome OS \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n \n Orion organization admins can view user spending by project and user. \n Orion organization admins can see all projects and jobs from all users. \n Orion organization admins can only see project names but not the data in the projects. \n Non-admins can only see their own projects and the projects shared with them. \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n \n On Orionâs home page, users can view information about: \n \n \n projects \n recent jobs \n system status \n expenses \n RSS feeds \n A new userâs default project is created when the new user is added to the system. \n Non-admin usersâ projects are listed on an admin userâs Home page. \n Duplicate project names are not allowed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n \n Each project has its own Summary page. From the Project Summary page, users can: \n \n \n edit or delete projects \n add notes, molecular structures, and files \n add or remove project members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n \n Usersâ datasets, collections, and files are displayed on the Project data page. \n Files can be uploaded to the  Project   Data  page and converted to datasets, while datasets can be downloaded in the usual molecular formats. \n Admin users can share files and datasets with the entire organization. \n Collections can be filtered by name. \n Datasets can be copied and/or duplicated. \n Users can share multiple datasets to a project or with multiple recipients in one operation. \n Users can add or remove data tags. \n Datasets can be viewed using Card View. \n Columns are sortable in Card View. \n Individual molecules can be selected from the Card View to send to a Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n \n The Analyze pageâs features include: \n \n \n a molecular spreadsheet \n graphing capabilitiesâscatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and violin plots \n 2D and 3D viewing \n molecule subset creation \n filtering and tagging \n cheminformatics functionsâsubstructure search, R-group decomposition, and property calculation \n \n \n \n Molecules can be sent directly to FastROCS from the Analyze page. \n Molecules can be sent directly to a Floe using the Send to Workfloe feature. \n Users can add comments and ratings for molecules in the Analyze page and the 3D Viewer. \n Conformer data can be displayed in the spreadsheet and plot. \n Receptors are by default designated as â3D Onlyâ datasets, to keep them out of property calculations and the Analyze page. \n Users can turn on binning on a per-column basis. \n \n \n \n \n Floe UI Â¶ \n \n \n Users can upload packages containing Cubes and Floes. \n Packages can be searched by name. \n Floes can be shared with other users. \n The Floe Editor allows users to build a new Floe or edit an existing Floe. \n Users can place Cubes in a Cube group. \n Cube groups can be deleted. \n Running jobs can be monitored graphically. \n Jobs can be filtered by project and user (admin-only functionality). \n Parameters can be marked as âhiddenâ by the Floe author. \n Initializer ports are colored blue to make them visually different from other port types. \n Archive files (i.e., tar and zip files) are importable. \n \n \n \n \n 3D Viewer Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer includes functionality for perceiving protein and ligand interactions as well as for editing facilities for ligands in the context of the active site. \n Users can convert molecules from 2D to 3D in the 3D Viewer. \n Keyboard navigation can be used to cycle through conformers. \n Users can send molecules from MMDS directly to the 3D Viewer. \n Surfaces can be Z-clipped independently of other 3D objects. \n \n \n \n \n Iterative Design Â¶ \n \n \n Iterative Design has functionality that allows users to generate new analogs of existing compounds. Users can edit molecules in 2D or 3D. Additionally, users can\nchoose from the following algorithms: \n \n \n Matched Molecular Pairs (MMP) \n Near Fragment Replacement (NPR) \n Reagent Join (RJ) \n Explore Sidechains (ES) \n \n \n \n Iterative Design and molecule builder tasks run on their own servers. \n Property plots handle multiple pages of data. \n If necessary, entry into an Iterative Design session can be cancelled by the user. \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n \n Two data services are available: \n \n \n MacroMolecular Data Service (MMDS), a protein structure repository \n FastROCS, a method for retrieving all similar structures by shape and color (aligned chemical groups) from a database \n \n \n \n Users can send molecules directly to Orion from either data service. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Includes storage costs for collections, datasets, files, and temporary files. \n $452.32 \n \n Total \n The sum of all expenses. \n $1,176.44 \n \n Deposits \n Orion  organization admin added funds. \n $0.00 \n \n \n \n \n \n Downloadable Cost Data Â¶ \n With an OCLI command, a user can generate a comma-separated-value (CSV) file containing a breakdown\nof cost data.  If you are a Managed Service customer, see  the documentation on the ocli cost export command .\nSaaS customers can open a support request to obtain a copy of this CSV. \n \n \n Jobs Â¶ \n The job charts are categorized by user or project. Job costs account for the majority of the EC2\n(compute servers) portion of the costs seen in the AWS Cost Breakdown. \n \n \n Ledger Entries Â¶ \n Orion  provides estimates of an organizationâs current balance and allocates costs to users and\nprojects. Even if  Orion  is not used for a period of time, a cost is incurred for stored data. \n At the end of each job,  Orion  estimates its cost and adds an entry to the\norganization ledger. \n Storage ledger entries are added periodically on a per-user basis. These\nare calculated by summing the sizes of collections, datasets, files, and other\nobjects stored in S3 on behalf of users. \n Ledger entries include  OpenEye âs markup. \n \n Ledger Entry Types Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Credit \n Admin added funds \n \n Adjustment \n Admin added expense \n \n Storage \n Per-user incremental storage expense for collections, datasets, files, and floe packages \n \n Job \n Per-job EC2 expense \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Collections, datasets, and raw data files are\naccessible here.  The data organization system implements familiar concepts of paths and folders\nto organize and access data in  Orion . \n The Programming Guide has additional technical details about data handling in Orion . \n \n Organizing and sharing data in folders Â¶ \n Users can organize the data according to the way they would like\nto share data among team members in a project. In addition, there are controlled data sharing\ncapabilities among members in the project. To achieve these objectives, the following main folders\nare available to users. \n \n My Data The data in this location are private and only\naccessible by the user. However, these data still can be shared by moving the data to a Shared\nSpace workspace. Data are put in My Data unless you specify otherwise in your upload. \n Only you can see the data until you share it to the Team or Shared folders. \n \n Team Data The data in this location are available to all project members. \n \n Shared Spaces The data in this location are available to the project members selected by the user. \n \n \n \n Orion provides automatic intraspection of files: hovering gives a depiction of the\nfirst structure if the file contains small molecules, or a protein schematic if amino acids\nare present. Selecting one or more datasets creates an active dataset. Active datasets are\ncarried forward to any feature domain (for example, moving to the Analyze page automatically\npopulates the spreadsheet). The  Project   Data  page also shows which filters are currently\napplied to the active data. \n \n Project Data Page Layout Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Add Data  button \n Allows users to add data by uploading files,  sketching , or importing a biomolecule. \n \n Search \n Allows users to search for collections, datasets, or files by name or tag. \n \n Show  drop-down \n Allows users to show any assortment of collections, datasets, and files. \n \n Sort by  drop-down \n Allows users sort by one of several options. \n \n Datasets Table \n Lists project datasets, sorted as specified by the  Sort   by:  drop-down. \n \n Trash Can \n Repository for deleted datasets. To restore the dataset, click on the Trash Can, select the dataset, and drag it to the\nappropriate folder. \n \n \n \n \n Tile View Â¶ \n Another form of intraspection is available for small molecule files: the tile view. Activate the tile view by\nclicking the   icon to the left of a dataset name.\nOn completion of the browsing of structures, click  Cancel , and you will be returned to the originating page. \n \n The tile view displays a panel list of structures in 2D or 3D, with associated\nproperties. It can be configured to display single structures, a side-by-side view, a grid compare view, or a grid view.\nEntries can be sorted by properties selected from all those available within the dataset.\nThe tile view is designed for fast traversal; selected structures can form the basis of a selected set on leaving\nthe page. \n \n \n What actions do I need to take if I had an account on a pre-2021 version of Orion? Â¶ \n If you have a pre-2021  Orion  account, you\nwill need to take some action on the shared data from previous  Orion  versions. \n \n Decide how to organize the data. \n Move all previously shared items into the appropriate folders. \n Assign collections to a project. \n \n \n AWS Representation \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can. Anything in the\nTrash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. \n In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ\noption. Please consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n \n Searching for data Â¶ \n You can search for datasets by entering a tag or resource name in the search\nbar. Select the main folder or space you would like to search. Next, enter the tag\nor resource name and click on that name. Then, the results will be shown at the bottom\nof the page. In addition, you will be able to see the path where this data can be\nfound. \n \n \n Uploading data Â¶ \n You can specify a path when uploading a file into  Orion . To specify a path,\nselect the folder or subfolders as applicable. Alternatively, you can go up a\ndirectory by clicking on the up arrow or using the backspace key.\nAlso, you can create a new subfolder by entering the name and then\nclicking on  Create   a   new   folder . \n \n CXSMILES Data Â¶ \n Data can be uploaded in CXSMILES format. (Data/My Data/+Add Data/Uploadâ¦.) \n \n \n \n Downloading and Exporting Data Â¶ \n You can download data, and it will be converted to a canonical format if necessary. \n \n Select dataset > More Actions > Export. \n In the Export pop-up, choose your preferred file format, then click Export. \n In the notification panel, you can check the status of your exports. \n After download, optionally move or delete the exported file from My Data Exports. \n \n \n \n Deleting data Â¶ \n To delete data, first select the data you want to delete\nby clicking on the square box on the left side to the folder or subfolder name.\nNext, click the   icon on the far right or in the top menu.\nMultiple data can be selected and deleted at once. Then, these data will be\nmoved to the  Trash  space. The items in the trash will be automatically deleted after\n30 days. \n \n \n Preserving Data of a Removed User Â¶ \n Customers can open a support request to remove a user from an organization, which\ntransfers ownership of that userâs data to project owners or an organization administrator. \n \n \n Subfolders Â¶ \n To create a new subfolder, first select the place\n( My   Data ,  Team   Data  or  Shared   Spaces ) where you want to create a new subfolder.\nThen, click on the   icon next to the path (example:\nMy Data). In the pop-up window, enter the\nfolder name and click  OK . A new subfolder will be created\nwith the specified name in the selected path. \n You can create a new folder or subfolder in the same window you use to\nupload data or when starting a floe run. To do this,\nselect the path and then enter the name of the\nsubfolder you want to create. A green bar\nwill appear with  Create   a   new   folder  next to the\nsubfolder name you just entered. Click on  Create   a \n new   folder . A new folder or subfolder will show up\non the path specified. \n \n Favorite subfolders Â¶ \n To quickly access a subfolder, you can mark it as a favorite by clicking\non the  star  next to the folder, and it will be added to the  Favorite   Folders  area in the left side column. \n \n \n Deleting subfolders Â¶ \n To delete a subfolder, select the subfolder you want to\ndelete and click on the   icon. The subfolder and all the contents in this\nsubfolder will be moved to the Trash space. The items in the trash will be automatically\ndeleted after 30 days. \n \n \n Moving a subfolder Â¶ \n A subfolder can be moved to another path or location. To do this, select the folder you\nwould like to move, and click either the bi-directional line icon on top or the ellipsis\nicon, and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path and click the  Move  button.\nThe subfolder (and its contents) will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n \n Video tutorial about project data Â¶ \n For more information on the use of the project data\nfacilities,  see the tutorial video . \n \n Note \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can.\nAnything in the Trash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ option.\nPlease consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n Moving data between projects Â¶ \n Data (datasets, files and collections) can be moved between projects, folders or subfolders.\nTo do this, select the data you would like to move and click the bi-directional line icon or\nthe ellipsis ( ... ) icon and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path, and click\nthe  Move  button. The selected data will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n Collection Metadata Â¶ \n Some collections feature an information icon ( ) that displays pregenerated metadata about the collection. The\ninformation may be helpful in working with collections, because you can see the metadata immediately, without having\nto run a floe. \n \n \n \n \n \n Discussion boards Â¶ \n You often need not only to share data with team members but also to discuss the results\nwith them. \n Discussion boards are accessed by the âchatâ icon ( ) on the  Project   Data  page. If you select the\nicon, you get a display on the right side of the screen that will be familiar from\nother chat experiences you have used. \n You can share links and images along with text comments, and discussions are preserved\nso you can revisit them.  The discussion board  autosaves usersâ edits. \n For an introduction, see this training video: Introducing Discussion Boards \n You can see further information in this training video: Using Discussion Boards . \n \n \n Shared spaces Â¶ \n To share data, use the  Shared   Spaces  main folder (or space). \n You can start by creating a workspace in  Shared   Spaces . Click on the  +  icon\nnext to the path. A pop-up window named  Workspace   name  will appear. Enter the\nname of the workspace you want to create and click  OK . \n A new subfolder with the\nspecified name will show in the Shared Spaces. If you click on this workspace,\nthen you will have the option to add members with whom you want to share the data. \n Click on the   icon and then click on  Edit   Users . Enter the name of the\nuser/project member you want to add. In this window, you will have the option\nto set the permissions (write, delete) you want for that user to have.  All the\ndata in this workspace will be shared with the selected users/project members. \n Alternatively, if you would like all project members to have access to the data,\nsave the data in the  Team   Data  space. \n The items ( workspaces ) in  Shared   Spaces  resemble folders, but they are actually file systems in their own right.  The user interface\nenforces the differences between workspaces and folders. \n \n Note \n With folders, access to data by others is determined by the folder you choose to use.  For example, things in the  Team   Data  folder\nare accessible to all members of the project team. For the workspaces within  Shared   Spaces , you can define a subset of users who have access to the workspace\nand its data.  You can pick the users by use of the   icon. \n \n \n Move, Drag-and-Drop The user interface does not show these actions for workspaces in the list of workspaces because they cannot be performed. \n \n Create and Rename and Delete You can perform these actions on workspaces. \n \n Inside a workspace Folders created within a workspace behave as other folders do. \n \n \n \n \n Workspace with contents Â¶ \n \n \n \n List of workspaces Â¶ \n \n \n \n Organization Data Page Â¶ \n \n \n Data available to an organization Â¶ \n \n The  Organization   Data  space allows for\nadmin users to share datasets and collections with the entire organization. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

If you hover over a name in the list and have the role,\nyou will be presented with a menu of options. \n \n Deleting Users Â¶ \n If you delete a user, you have the option of specifying another user\nto take ownership of the deleted userâs resources. \n \n Transfer of Ownership Â¶ \n \n Note \n Before deleting a user, which is  not reversible , be sure you understand how the userâs\nprojects and data\nwill be reassigned. \n \n After a user account is deleted, all the userâs projects and data are transferred to a selected\nuser. \n The new owner may have an admin or non-admin user role. \n \n Special Consideration about Projects Â¶ \n The transfer of ownership of projects and data is immediate unless a project is not shared with the new owner. \n In that case, it might take a few minutes to update the name of the new project owner. \n Projects and data that were transferred to a new owner will be labeled as ( fromâ¦ ) or ( deleted   fromâ¦ )\nHere, for example, Brendaâs Project in the deleted brenda-test user account was transferred to a new owner, Amanda Ghilardi. \n \n \n Brendaâs Project, Now Transferred to a New Owner, Amanda Â¶ \n \n Any data generated by another user in the deleted account will also be transferred. \n \n \n Where to Find Transferred Data Â¶ \n The deleted userâs data are disposed of in the following ways. \n \n All data stored in the  My   Data  folder in the deleted user account are transferred to a folder in\n Shared   Spaces . These data are shared only with the new owner. \n All data stored in the  Team   Data  folder in the deleted user account  remain in the  Team   Data  folder. \n All data stored in  Shared   Spaces  in the deleted user account  remain in  Shared   Spaces  with the same\nsharing permissions. \n \n \n \n \n Deleting a User Â¶ \n Navigate to the  System  page. Click on the  Users  tab.\nSearch by username, email and filter by role. Click on the  Delete  option. The following dialog appears. \n \n \n Preparing to Delete a User and Reassign Ownership Â¶ \n \n Notice that deletion of a user cannot be undone.  You are asked to confirm in this dialog and to specify\na new owner.  First, check  Continue   with   deleting   process . Select the new owner of the projects\nand data. Only one user can be selected. Finally, check   Enable   delete   button  and click   Delete   User . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Orion can be accessed either directly through\nthe customerâs relationship with AWS or indirectly through  OpenEye . \n Orion is an open platform that allows for straightforward integration of third-party code (i.e., from customers, academics, and vendors). The Orion\nfront end is a webpage, deliverable on any internet-enabled supported platform. \n \n Supported Browsers Â¶ \n \n \n Orion supports the most recent stable desktop versions of MozillaÂ® FirefoxÂ® and Google Chromeâ¢. \n \n \n \n Hint \n Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), Microsoft Edge, and macOS Safari are not supported. \n \n \n \n Supported Platforms Â¶ \n \n \n Windows \n macOS \n Linux \n Chrome OS \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n \n Orion organization admins can view user spending by project and user. \n Orion organization admins can see all projects and jobs from all users. \n Orion organization admins can only see project names but not the data in the projects. \n Non-admins can only see their own projects and the projects shared with them. \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n \n On Orionâs home page, users can view information about: \n \n \n projects \n recent jobs \n system status \n expenses \n RSS feeds \n A new userâs default project is created when the new user is added to the system. \n Non-admin usersâ projects are listed on an admin userâs Home page. \n Duplicate project names are not allowed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n \n Each project has its own Summary page. From the Project Summary page, users can: \n \n \n edit or delete projects \n add notes, molecular structures, and files \n add or remove project members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n \n Usersâ datasets, collections, and files are displayed on the Project data page. \n Files can be uploaded to the  Project   Data  page and converted to datasets, while datasets can be downloaded in the usual molecular formats. \n Admin users can share files and datasets with the entire organization. \n Collections can be filtered by name. \n Datasets can be copied and/or duplicated. \n Users can share multiple datasets to a project or with multiple recipients in one operation. \n Users can add or remove data tags. \n Datasets can be viewed using Card View. \n Columns are sortable in Card View. \n Individual molecules can be selected from the Card View to send to a Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n \n The Analyze pageâs features include: \n \n \n a molecular spreadsheet \n graphing capabilitiesâscatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and violin plots \n 2D and 3D viewing \n molecule subset creation \n filtering and tagging \n cheminformatics functionsâsubstructure search, R-group decomposition, and property calculation \n \n \n \n Molecules can be sent directly to FastROCS from the Analyze page. \n Molecules can be sent directly to a Floe using the Send to Workfloe feature. \n Users can add comments and ratings for molecules in the Analyze page and the 3D Viewer. \n Conformer data can be displayed in the spreadsheet and plot. \n Receptors are by default designated as â3D Onlyâ datasets, to keep them out of property calculations and the Analyze page. \n Users can turn on binning on a per-column basis. \n \n \n \n \n Floe UI Â¶ \n \n \n Users can upload packages containing Cubes and Floes. \n Packages can be searched by name. \n Floes can be shared with other users. \n The Floe Editor allows users to build a new Floe or edit an existing Floe. \n Users can place Cubes in a Cube group. \n Cube groups can be deleted. \n Running jobs can be monitored graphically. \n Jobs can be filtered by project and user (admin-only functionality). \n Parameters can be marked as âhiddenâ by the Floe author. \n Initializer ports are colored blue to make them visually different from other port types. \n Archive files (i.e., tar and zip files) are importable. \n \n \n \n \n 3D Viewer Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer includes functionality for perceiving protein and ligand interactions as well as for editing facilities for ligands in the context of the active site. \n Users can convert molecules from 2D to 3D in the 3D Viewer. \n Keyboard navigation can be used to cycle through conformers. \n Users can send molecules from MMDS directly to the 3D Viewer. \n Surfaces can be Z-clipped independently of other 3D objects. \n \n \n \n \n Iterative Design Â¶ \n \n \n Iterative Design has functionality that allows users to generate new analogs of existing compounds. Users can edit molecules in 2D or 3D. Additionally, users can\nchoose from the following algorithms: \n \n \n Matched Molecular Pairs (MMP) \n Near Fragment Replacement (NPR) \n Reagent Join (RJ) \n Explore Sidechains (ES) \n \n \n \n Iterative Design and molecule builder tasks run on their own servers. \n Property plots handle multiple pages of data. \n If necessary, entry into an Iterative Design session can be cancelled by the user. \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n \n Two data services are available: \n \n \n MacroMolecular Data Service (MMDS), a protein structure repository \n FastROCS, a method for retrieving all similar structures by shape and color (aligned chemical groups) from a database \n \n \n \n Users can send molecules directly to Orion from either data service. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

These data are shared only with the new owner. \n All data stored in the  Team   Data  folder in the deleted user account  remain in the  Team   Data  folder. \n All data stored in  Shared   Spaces  in the deleted user account  remain in  Shared   Spaces  with the same\nsharing permissions. \n \n \n \n \n Deleting a User Â¶ \n Navigate to the  System  page. Click on the  Users  tab.\nSearch by username, email and filter by role. Click on the  Delete  option. The following dialog appears. \n \n \n Preparing to Delete a User and Reassign Ownership Â¶ \n \n Notice that deletion of a user cannot be undone.  You are asked to confirm in this dialog and to specify\na new owner.  First, check  Continue   with   deleting   process . Select the new owner of the projects\nand data. Only one user can be selected.

From the Project Summary page, users can: \n \n \n edit or delete projects \n add notes, molecular structures, and files \n add or remove project members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n \n Usersâ datasets, collections, and files are displayed on the Project data page. \n Files can be uploaded to the  Project   Data  page and converted to datasets, while datasets can be downloaded in the usual molecular formats. \n Admin users can share files and datasets with the entire organization. \n Collections can be filtered by name. \n Datasets can be copied and/or duplicated. \n Users can share multiple datasets to a project or with multiple recipients in one operation. \n Users can add or remove data tags. \n Datasets can be viewed using Card View. \n Columns are sortable in Card View. \n Individual molecules can be selected from the Card View to send to a Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n \n The Analyze pageâs features include: \n \n \n a molecular spreadsheet \n graphing capabilitiesâscatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and violin plots \n 2D and 3D viewing \n molecule subset creation \n filtering and tagging \n cheminformatics functionsâsubstructure search, R-group decomposition, and property calculation \n \n \n \n Molecules can be sent directly to FastROCS from the Analyze page. \n Molecules can be sent directly to a Floe using the Send to Workfloe feature. \n Users can add comments and ratings for molecules in the Analyze page and the 3D Viewer. \n Conformer data can be displayed in the spreadsheet and plot. \n Receptors are by default designated as â3D Onlyâ datasets, to keep them out of property calculations and the Analyze page. \n Users can turn on binning on a per-column basis. \n \n \n \n \n Floe UI Â¶ \n \n \n Users can upload packages containing Cubes and Floes. \n Packages can be searched by name. \n Floes can be shared with other users. \n The Floe Editor allows users to build a new Floe or edit an existing Floe. \n Users can place Cubes in a Cube group. \n Cube groups can be deleted. \n Running jobs can be monitored graphically. \n Jobs can be filtered by project and user (admin-only functionality). \n Parameters can be marked as âhiddenâ by the Floe author. \n Initializer ports are colored blue to make them visually different from other port types. \n Archive files (i.e., tar and zip files) are importable. \n \n \n \n \n 3D Viewer Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer includes functionality for perceiving protein and ligand interactions as well as for editing facilities for ligands in the context of the active site. \n Users can convert molecules from 2D to 3D in the 3D Viewer. \n Keyboard navigation can be used to cycle through conformers. \n Users can send molecules from MMDS directly to the 3D Viewer. \n Surfaces can be Z-clipped independently of other 3D objects. \n \n \n \n \n Iterative Design Â¶ \n \n \n Iterative Design has functionality that allows users to generate new analogs of existing compounds. Users can edit molecules in 2D or 3D. Additionally, users can\nchoose from the following algorithms: \n \n \n Matched Molecular Pairs (MMP) \n Near Fragment Replacement (NPR) \n Reagent Join (RJ) \n Explore Sidechains (ES) \n \n \n \n Iterative Design and molecule builder tasks run on their own servers. \n Property plots handle multiple pages of data. \n If necessary, entry into an Iterative Design session can be cancelled by the user. \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n \n Two data services are available: \n \n \n MacroMolecular Data Service (MMDS), a protein structure repository \n FastROCS, a method for retrieving all similar structures by shape and color (aligned chemical groups) from a database \n \n \n \n Users can send molecules directly to Orion from either data service. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

You can find links\nto them in this section and in relevant places elsewhere in this manual.  For a list of all tutorial videos,\nsee  Orion Video Tutorials . \n \n Data organization video Â¶ \n The features for organizing data have been revamped significantly.  For an introduction, try\nthis video:\n Data Organization in Orion . \n \n \n Discussion board videos Â¶ \n Discussion boards are a new user interface feature introduced in this version, accessed\nvia an icon on the  Project   Data  page:\n Introducing Discussion Boards \n We welcome your feedback on discussion boards after you have used them:\n Using Discussion Boards . \n For more about discussion boards, see  Discussion boards . \n \n \n 3D modeling videos Â¶ \n There are new badge and list features on the  3D   Modeling  page.\nHere is an introduction:  Badges and Lists in Orion . \n There are several more new videos about 3D modeling at  Orion Video Tutorials . \n \n \n \n Highlights Â¶ \n \n \n This release introduces a revamped  Project   Data  page which now uses a path- and folder-based file system for data organization. \n A desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders, or launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections as part of data migration. \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the  Home  page when users first login to Orion. \n Many enhancements have been made to  3D   Modeling  page, including several new tools for protein editing. \n Molecules, proteins, and other components of a dataset can now be identified using badges. \n Tooltips in the  3D   Viewer  have been enhanced. \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n A new discussion board Beta  feature is now available. \n This release introduces Orion stack protection through rate-limiting. \n Job cost email alerts can now be created. \n A dedicated  Organization   Data  project has been added. The data in this project are available to all Organization users and are prepopulated with\nOpenEye Data such as Collections used for virtual screening. \n New Floes have been added to  Floe  packages including: \n \n \n Non-Equilibrium Switching (NES) Floes in the MD Floe package. \n Cluster Poses, FastROCS,  and FreeForm Pose Floes in the Large-Scale-Floes package. \n Large-Scale Reaction Enumeration Floes in the Generative Design Floe package. \n \n \n \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types. \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Orion stack protection through rate-limiting has been implemented. \n Job cost email alerts are now available. Organization admins can set Job cost limits alerts for the entire organization on the Profile page. In addition, users can set\nJob cost limits alerts and Job termination thresholds for their own jobs on the Profile page. Job cost alerts can also be set prior to running a job on the Job Form.\nThese cost thresholds can be updated while a Job is running on the Job Status page. \n This release introduces a new Discussion Board Beta . Saved discussions may contain notes, images, or snapshot links of the 3D Modeling or Analyze pages.\nDiscussions are accessible to all team members. \n Substructure searching is now accessible from the databar filters. This functionality was previously available only on the Analyze page. \n Cubes which are being throttled now show up with special coloring. \n More information has been added to Job Debugging Data. \n A new instance-draining state has been added, which allows jobs to continue running but prevents new jobs from using the instance. \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types.\nFor new data being written to a dataset, it will be cast/coerced/promoted to the type of the existing dataset field. This matches what drconvert does.\nWhen writing records, if an incompatible type of data for a given field name is seen, the writer generates a new alternate field and stores the data in\nan alternate field rather than failing the writing process. \n \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the Home page when users first login to Orion. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A dedicated Organization Data project has been added. Data in this project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. In addition, the\nOrganization Data project is pre-populated with OpenEye-supplied data such as the Brood database, OpenEye-prepared third-party vendor collections for virtual screening,\ntutorial datasets, and other data that can be used as input to some of the included Orion Floes.  Note : The Organization Data project is only visible to Organization\nadmins in the list of projects in the Navbar and Home page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Organization admins now have control over the listing of projects on the Home page and Navbar on the Project Summary page. Organization admins can now toggle between\nâShow Allâ Organization projects and âShow Ownâ projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The Project Data page has been overhauled and now uses a folder-based file system for organizing your data, instead of a flat view. \n Within a project, data are organized into three main areas: \n \n \n My Data â your private data. No other users have access to this data. \n Team Data â data that are available to all project members. \n Shared Spaces â data that are available to select project members, i.e. shared data among the selected project members. \n \n \n \n New folders can be created from the Project Data page, when uploading data, and when launching a Floe from the Job Form. \n A dedicated Organization Data project is available to everyone in the Organization and is located above the Project Data folder hierarchy. Data in\nthis project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. \n The path to a desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders or when launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Folders and subfolders can be added to the  Favorite   Folders  space for quick and easy access. \n Data are now shared by creating a workspace in the âShared Foldersâ main folder. Permissions can be set for each user added to the workspace. \n Drag and drop functionality allows users to move collections, datasets, and/or files to the three main data areas, Trash can or other subfolders. \n String Search will search within the current folder or all project folders, i.e.,  My Data,  Team Data or Shared Spaces. \n Discussion boards Beta  can be created within a workspace to highlight and annotate data within that workspace, and can be viewed by all of that workspaceâs members. \n As part of the data migration, users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections. Collections now belong to projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n 3D Modeling Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer list is now record-focused. \n Badges to identify molecules, proteins and other components of datasets have been added to the 3D Viewer list. \n Tools for protein editing, including protonation state modification, capping terminal residues, and residue mutation have been added. \n When mutating protein residues, multiple residues can be selected and users can walk through applying a mutation to each residue in the selected set. \n Most of the small molecule editing tools can now be applied to proteins as well. \n The 3D molecule editor now contains the same set of molecular fragment templates as the 2D sketcher. \n An edited protein can be saved as a new dataset. \n A new receptor in OEDesignUnit (DU) display has been added. \n OEDesignUnit components can be edited and saved in place. \n Receptor ligands can be edited but not in place. Users need to make a copy of the ligand before editing.  Note : Receptor proteins cannot be edited. \n More options to save edited small molecules are now available. \n Users can edit datasets they donât own in place but need to save them to new datasets. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views.

Floes are constructed of cubes, which are small programming elements. Floes and cubes\nare uploaded and incorporated into  Orion  as tar packages or docker images. (See  the development instructions\nin the Programming Guide for more information about packaging .) When loaded, floes can be\nshared like any other dataset. Uploaded\nfloes are found in and run from the  Floes  tab and the  Editor  tab.\nIn the  Floes  tab, they can also be assigned to other feature domains. \n \n When a floe is launched, its progress can be\nfollowed graphically and in real time.  A floe in progress is shown in the  Jobs  tab, with different\ncolors indicating the status of the cubes. \n \n \n Figure 1. A Floe in Progress Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n A cost analysis is available before, during, and after each\nfloe. After each floe completes, a notification is posted that can be viewed by clicking the  Notifications  icon ( ).\n(When you launch a floe, or in your profile, you can also ask to receive an email when a job completes.)   The job\nmay also produce output datasets or an\nHTML report file. A log file of the floe job is also presented. \n Job cost alerts can be set globally for all floe runs in the Profile section.\nUsers can modify job cost thresholds in the Job Form before launching a floe and during the run. \n \n Specify a Path when Launching a Floe Run Â¶ \n A path or location can be specified in the job\nsubmission form. When launching a floe run, you will see an\n Output   path  property field. The default path will be\n Project   Name/My   Data . You can type in a new directory name,\nwhich will be created when the output is written. To go up a directory, click on\nthe up arrow or use the backspace key to move up one\ndirectory. Finally, select the path you want. \n \n \n Find a Floe in Orion Â¶ \n You can find a particular floe, out of the many available, using the  Floe  page with these techniques: \n \n Navigate to the floe using the categories in the left-hand pane. \n \n The  Created   in   Floe   Editor  category shows floes that do not have an associated package and thus were likely\ncreated in the  Editor .   See the Programming Guide for more information about the Floe\nEditor . \n The  Packages  category groups floes according to the packages in which they are built.  You may be familiar\nwith this nomenclature from past releases.  For example, selecting the package  OpenEye  Biomodeler Floes in the\ndrop-down displays the floes associated with that package. \n The  Product-based  category corresponds to the names of  OpenEye  products, such as  BROOD .  This\ncategory is one deep: if you select  BROOD , you will get the list of floes associated with that product, displayed\nin the right-hand pane. \n The  Role-based ,  Solution-based , and  Task-based  categories are deeper, meaning you might go through\none or more subcategories to get to a specific list of floes. \n \n \n Search for the floe using the search bar labeled âSearch Floes and Categoriesâ in the right-hand pane.  This search looks for\nthe search term among the category terms and in the brief description of the floe.  The brief appears in a list of\nfloes; it is not the longer description that appears when you display an individual floe.\nThe search should give you a concise list of relevant floes. \n \n \n \n Figure 2.

Depending on the organizationâs Orion settings, non-SSO passwords associated with the\nOrion account can be updated here. For SSO passwords, please contact your organizationâs\nadministrator for help. \n The  Projects  Tab lists projects that you do not own but that are shared with you. The\nnumber of datasets, records, and files for a project is listed here, as well as the project owner.\nFor each project, clicking the âLeave Projectâ icon under the Action column will produce a pop-up\nwindow asking for confirmation to leave the project.\nNote: After a user leaves a project, the project admin must add them again for the user to\naccess that project. \n Global settings can be found on the  Preferences  Tab. The âNotificationâ toggle filters all Orion\nnotification windows for your current project. If you want to focus on a single\nproject, this option prevents notifications for jobs in other projects. The âTaskâ toggle allows\nyou to select email notification for the completion of Orion tasks such as job completions or\nfailures. It is important to note that this email address is the one listed on the  Profile  Tab of\nOrion. All settings on the  Preferences  Tab can be reset by clicking the red\nâResetâ button. Global job cost limits can be set for both an email notification and for job\ntermination when a job reaches a specific threshold. Any cost threshold that is set for the\nglobal preferences on this page can be overwritten on the Job Form or under the  Jobs  Tab of the\nFloe page. For best practices concerning global job cost limits, contact your\norganizationâs Orion administrator or contact OpenEye customer support. \n \n Note \n It is highly recommended to set a global cost limit for the email notification. \n \n \n Caution \n If a job reaches the job cost termination limit, the job will  not  shut down cleanly, and the results may  not  be recoverable. \n \n \n \n Figure 1.  The Preferences Tab. Â¶ \n \n The  Expenses  Tab displays the total costs for each project and for storage in the past 24 hours, 7\ndays, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year. This information includes deleted project costs when\napplicable. \n The  Tokens  Tab provides information for orionclient or OCLI users. All of a userâs tokens are\nlisted here, whether they were created from this tab or through OCLI. Tokens are created by\ndefault when a profile is configured via OCLI without an existing token. Tokens can also be created by services (such as\nMMDS) on your behalf. To create a token from\nthis tab, click the âCreate Tokenâ button and proceed as directed. To copy a token, click the\nâEyeâ icon to make the token visible and then click the âClipboardâ icon, which will turn green\nwith a checkmark to indicate that the token has been copied to your clipboard. Once the token\nis copied, paste it into the OCLI Config file; it can also be used as input using \n ocli config profile --with-token \n \n \n For more information concerning tokens and how to use them, see\nthe  Orion Programming Guide  for  configuration commands  for Orion profiles and the Quick Start guide\non  authenticating with Orion . \n \n Orion Admin View Â¶ \n Users with an Admin role in Orion have the additional  Organization  Tab. From this tab,\nAdmins can make changes that affect every user within the organization. On the left, an image\nof the organizationâs logo or name can be uploaded. On the right, the name of the organization\ncan be updated. Additionally, similar to the cost thresholds described above, an Admin can set\norganization-level thresholds. These thresholds will become the default for everyone within the\norganization. However, users may still change these thresholds on a personal level (as described\nabove) or the job level (see the  Floe page ). \n \n \n Figure 2.  Tabs on the Profile Page for Admins.

Collections, datasets, and raw data files are\naccessible here.  The data organization system implements familiar concepts of paths and folders\nto organize and access data in  Orion . \n The Programming Guide has additional technical details about data handling in Orion . \n \n Organizing and sharing data in folders Â¶ \n Users can organize the data according to the way they would like\nto share data among team members in a project. In addition, there are controlled data sharing\ncapabilities among members in the project. To achieve these objectives, the following main folders\nare available to users. \n \n My Data The data in this location are private and only\naccessible by the user. However, these data still can be shared by moving the data to a Shared\nSpace workspace. Data are put in My Data unless you specify otherwise in your upload. \n Only you can see the data until you share it to the Team or Shared folders. \n \n Team Data The data in this location are available to all project members. \n \n Shared Spaces The data in this location are available to the project members selected by the user. \n \n \n \n Orion provides automatic intraspection of files: hovering gives a depiction of the\nfirst structure if the file contains small molecules, or a protein schematic if amino acids\nare present. Selecting one or more datasets creates an active dataset. Active datasets are\ncarried forward to any feature domain (for example, moving to the Analyze page automatically\npopulates the spreadsheet). The  Project   Data  page also shows which filters are currently\napplied to the active data. \n \n Project Data Page Layout Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Add Data  button \n Allows users to add data by uploading files,  sketching , or importing a biomolecule. \n \n Search \n Allows users to search for collections, datasets, or files by name or tag. \n \n Show  drop-down \n Allows users to show any assortment of collections, datasets, and files. \n \n Sort by  drop-down \n Allows users sort by one of several options. \n \n Datasets Table \n Lists project datasets, sorted as specified by the  Sort   by:  drop-down. \n \n Trash Can \n Repository for deleted datasets. To restore the dataset, click on the Trash Can, select the dataset, and drag it to the\nappropriate folder. \n \n \n \n \n Tile View Â¶ \n Another form of intraspection is available for small molecule files: the tile view. Activate the tile view by\nclicking the   icon to the left of a dataset name.\nOn completion of the browsing of structures, click  Cancel , and you will be returned to the originating page. \n \n The tile view displays a panel list of structures in 2D or 3D, with associated\nproperties. It can be configured to display single structures, a side-by-side view, a grid compare view, or a grid view.\nEntries can be sorted by properties selected from all those available within the dataset.\nThe tile view is designed for fast traversal; selected structures can form the basis of a selected set on leaving\nthe page. \n \n \n What actions do I need to take if I had an account on a pre-2021 version of Orion? Â¶ \n If you have a pre-2021  Orion  account, you\nwill need to take some action on the shared data from previous  Orion  versions. \n \n Decide how to organize the data. \n Move all previously shared items into the appropriate folders. \n Assign collections to a project. \n \n \n AWS Representation \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can. Anything in the\nTrash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. \n In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ\noption. Please consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n \n Searching for data Â¶ \n You can search for datasets by entering a tag or resource name in the search\nbar. Select the main folder or space you would like to search. Next, enter the tag\nor resource name and click on that name. Then, the results will be shown at the bottom\nof the page. In addition, you will be able to see the path where this data can be\nfound. \n \n \n Uploading data Â¶ \n You can specify a path when uploading a file into  Orion . To specify a path,\nselect the folder or subfolders as applicable. Alternatively, you can go up a\ndirectory by clicking on the up arrow or using the backspace key.\nAlso, you can create a new subfolder by entering the name and then\nclicking on  Create   a   new   folder . \n \n CXSMILES Data Â¶ \n Data can be uploaded in CXSMILES format. (Data/My Data/+Add Data/Uploadâ¦.) \n \n \n \n Downloading and Exporting Data Â¶ \n You can download data, and it will be converted to a canonical format if necessary. \n \n Select dataset > More Actions > Export. \n In the Export pop-up, choose your preferred file format, then click Export. \n In the notification panel, you can check the status of your exports. \n After download, optionally move or delete the exported file from My Data Exports. \n \n \n \n Deleting data Â¶ \n To delete data, first select the data you want to delete\nby clicking on the square box on the left side to the folder or subfolder name.\nNext, click the   icon on the far right or in the top menu.\nMultiple data can be selected and deleted at once. Then, these data will be\nmoved to the  Trash  space. The items in the trash will be automatically deleted after\n30 days. \n \n \n Preserving Data of a Removed User Â¶ \n Customers can open a support request to remove a user from an organization, which\ntransfers ownership of that userâs data to project owners or an organization administrator. \n \n \n Subfolders Â¶ \n To create a new subfolder, first select the place\n( My   Data ,  Team   Data  or  Shared   Spaces ) where you want to create a new subfolder.\nThen, click on the   icon next to the path (example:\nMy Data). In the pop-up window, enter the\nfolder name and click  OK . A new subfolder will be created\nwith the specified name in the selected path. \n You can create a new folder or subfolder in the same window you use to\nupload data or when starting a floe run. To do this,\nselect the path and then enter the name of the\nsubfolder you want to create. A green bar\nwill appear with  Create   a   new   folder  next to the\nsubfolder name you just entered. Click on  Create   a \n new   folder . A new folder or subfolder will show up\non the path specified. \n \n Favorite subfolders Â¶ \n To quickly access a subfolder, you can mark it as a favorite by clicking\non the  star  next to the folder, and it will be added to the  Favorite   Folders  area in the left side column. \n \n \n Deleting subfolders Â¶ \n To delete a subfolder, select the subfolder you want to\ndelete and click on the   icon. The subfolder and all the contents in this\nsubfolder will be moved to the Trash space. The items in the trash will be automatically\ndeleted after 30 days. \n \n \n Moving a subfolder Â¶ \n A subfolder can be moved to another path or location. To do this, select the folder you\nwould like to move, and click either the bi-directional line icon on top or the ellipsis\nicon, and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path and click the  Move  button.\nThe subfolder (and its contents) will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n \n Video tutorial about project data Â¶ \n For more information on the use of the project data\nfacilities,  see the tutorial video . \n \n Note \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can.\nAnything in the Trash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ option.\nPlease consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n Moving data between projects Â¶ \n Data (datasets, files and collections) can be moved between projects, folders or subfolders.\nTo do this, select the data you would like to move and click the bi-directional line icon or\nthe ellipsis ( ... ) icon and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path, and click\nthe  Move  button. The selected data will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n Collection Metadata Â¶ \n Some collections feature an information icon ( ) that displays pregenerated metadata about the collection. The\ninformation may be helpful in working with collections, because you can see the metadata immediately, without having\nto run a floe. \n \n \n \n \n \n Discussion boards Â¶ \n You often need not only to share data with team members but also to discuss the results\nwith them. \n Discussion boards are accessed by the âchatâ icon ( ) on the  Project   Data  page. If you select the\nicon, you get a display on the right side of the screen that will be familiar from\nother chat experiences you have used. \n You can share links and images along with text comments, and discussions are preserved\nso you can revisit them.  The discussion board  autosaves usersâ edits. \n For an introduction, see this training video: Introducing Discussion Boards \n You can see further information in this training video: Using Discussion Boards . \n \n \n Shared spaces Â¶ \n To share data, use the  Shared   Spaces  main folder (or space). \n You can start by creating a workspace in  Shared   Spaces . Click on the  +  icon\nnext to the path. A pop-up window named  Workspace   name  will appear. Enter the\nname of the workspace you want to create and click  OK . \n A new subfolder with the\nspecified name will show in the Shared Spaces. If you click on this workspace,\nthen you will have the option to add members with whom you want to share the data. \n Click on the   icon and then click on  Edit   Users . Enter the name of the\nuser/project member you want to add. In this window, you will have the option\nto set the permissions (write, delete) you want for that user to have.  All the\ndata in this workspace will be shared with the selected users/project members. \n Alternatively, if you would like all project members to have access to the data,\nsave the data in the  Team   Data  space. \n The items ( workspaces ) in  Shared   Spaces  resemble folders, but they are actually file systems in their own right.  The user interface\nenforces the differences between workspaces and folders. \n \n Note \n With folders, access to data by others is determined by the folder you choose to use.  For example, things in the  Team   Data  folder\nare accessible to all members of the project team. For the workspaces within  Shared   Spaces , you can define a subset of users who have access to the workspace\nand its data.  You can pick the users by use of the   icon. \n \n \n Move, Drag-and-Drop The user interface does not show these actions for workspaces in the list of workspaces because they cannot be performed. \n \n Create and Rename and Delete You can perform these actions on workspaces. \n \n Inside a workspace Folders created within a workspace behave as other folders do. \n \n \n \n \n Workspace with contents Â¶ \n \n \n \n List of workspaces Â¶ \n \n \n \n Organization Data Page Â¶ \n \n \n Data available to an organization Â¶ \n \n The  Organization   Data  space allows for\nadmin users to share datasets and collections with the entire organization. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder\nof the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with\nthe compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs\nto use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process,\nor makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified\nlater version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with\nGCC in accord with the license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable\nform or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code\ndoes not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a\ncompiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written\ncode, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and\npreprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood\nas starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is\ndone without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate\nrepresentations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules,\neven if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by\nEligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the\nlicensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by\nthe copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.\n \n \n \n See also \n \n http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception.html \n \n \n \n \n GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Â¶ \n                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                     Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                          Preamble\n\n The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\n software and other kinds of works.\n\n   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\n to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\n the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n your programs, too.\n\n   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\n know their rights.\n\n   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n authors of previous versions.\n\n   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n modification follow.\n\n                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   0. Definitions.\n\n   \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n   \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n   \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\n exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\n earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n on the Program.\n\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\n permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\n distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\n public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\n a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n   An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\n to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\n the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n   1. Source Code.\n\n   The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\n for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\n form of a work.\n\n   A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\n standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\n is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n   The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\n than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n   The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\n the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\n System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\n which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\n includes interface definition files associated with source files for\n the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\n linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\n such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\n subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n Source.\n\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\n same work.\n\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\n covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\n rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n makes it unnecessary.\n\n   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n measures.\n\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n technological measures.\n\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\n recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\n in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\n parts of the aggregate.\n\n   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\n machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\n in one of these ways:\n\n   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n   Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n   customarily used for software interchange.\n\n   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n   written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n   long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n   model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n   copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n   product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n   medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n   more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n   conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n   Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n   written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n   alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n   only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n   with subsection 6b.\n\n   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n   place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n   Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n   further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n   Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n   copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n   may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n   that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n   clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n   Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n   Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n   available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n   you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n   Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n   charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\n restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n where to find the applicable terms.\n\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n the above requirements apply either way.\n\n   8. Termination.\n\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n paragraph of section 11).\n\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\n holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n your receipt of the notice.\n\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\n material under section 10.\n\n   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\n for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n   An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\n organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\n not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n   11. Patents.\n\n   A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\n work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n   A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\n owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\n by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\n consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\n purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\n patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\n this License.\n\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\n make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\n propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\n agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\n party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n patent against the party.\n\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\n publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\n then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\n available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\n consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\n license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\n actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\n in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n work and works based on it.\n\n   A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\n the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\n work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\n in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\n to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\n covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\n the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\n combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\n License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\n but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n combination as such.\n\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\n the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n address new problems or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\n Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\n Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\n option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\n version or of any later version published by the Free Software\n Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\n GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\n by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\n public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\n to choose that version for the Program.\n\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different\n permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\n author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\n later version.\n\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\n HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\n OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\n THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\n IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\n ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\n THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\n USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\n DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\n PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\n EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\n above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\n reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\n an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\n Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\n copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n     (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n     GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\n notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\n The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\n parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\n might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\n if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\n For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\n into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\n may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\n the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\n Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n \n \n \n See also \n \n http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

It also\nshows how to use an assortment of user interface features, such as examination of binding sites. \n DNA gyrase (GyrB) and topoisomerase IV (Topo IV) are clinically validated targets for the treatment of\nresistant bacterial infections. In a study carried out at a big Pharma, pyrrolamides were shown to exhibit\nantibacterial activity by competing with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in DNA gyrase and Topo IV. \n In this simulation, your role as the only modeler on the pyrrolamides optimization project\nis to guide the medicinal chemists\nin their design decisions; they want suggestions on what to synthesize next. Your ultimate goal is to help\nthem synthesize the depicted compound. \n \n \n Figure 1: Target Compound Â¶ \n \n You will explore  docking  in this retrospective study. In the drug discovery process, structure-based methods such\nas dockingâthe lock-and-key concept where the protein is the lock and the ligand is the keyâuse the structure of\na target protein to discover hits and optimize leads. In hit discovery or virtual screening, no molecules are\nknown that are active\nagainst the target protein. Docking is used to identify possible active molecules in a large molecule database,\nby examining their shapes and chemical complementarity to the active site. \n Datasets \n \n \n Initial ligands: pyrrolamides_3D.sdf â download the dataset below. \n Receptor: 3TTZ_A_receptor â download the receptor below. \n Conformer database â generate from pyrrolamides_3D dataset (see below). \n \n \n \n Download dataset of initial ligands \n pyrrolamides_3D.sdf \n \n \n Download receptor \n 3TTZ_A__receptor.oeb \n \n After completing this task, you will be able to: \n \n \n Upload datasets into  Orion \n Run an  Omega  floe \n Retrieve a receptor from a database \n Identify the binding pocket \n Perceive protein-ligand interactions \n Run a docking floe \n Analyze docking results in the  Analyze  page \n Perform a substructure search \n Add property data to a spreadsheet \n Sort the data in a spreadsheet \n Export data \n \n \n \n Navigate to the  Orion  Home page and create a project called âDocking Demo.â \n \n \n \n Figure 2.  By Default, Orion Switches to the New Project Automatically Â¶ \n \n \n Navigate to the  Data  (Project Data) page and upload the ligand file pyrrolamides_3D.sdf. \n \n \n \n Figure 3: Adding Data Â¶ \n \n \n \n Figure 4: Ready to Upload a File of Data Â¶ \n \n A dialog pops up showing that the upload is in progress, then a conversion floe, File to Dataset Import, runs quickly, producing a\ndataset from the uploaded file. \n You can see the recent notifications by clicking the  Notifications  icon ( ). \n \n \n Figure 5: Notification List Â¶ \n \n The end result is shown here. \n \n \n Figure 6: Requesting Job Details Â¶ \n \n The icon next to the job details on the upper right ( ) shows the job that produced the dataset.  A job is\nan instance of a workflow, or floe, in this case the format conversion floe File to Dataset Import. \n \n \n Figure 7: A Successfully Completed Job Â¶ \n \n Here, a File to Record Converter cube uploaded and converted the ligand file and then it fed its output to the Dataset Writer\ncube. \n \n Switch to the  Floe  (Workfloe) page, select the  OMEGA   -   3D   Conformer   Ensemble   Generation  Floe and generate ligand conformers. \n \n \n \n Figure 8: Listing Floes That Use Omega Â¶ \n \n \n \n Figure 9: Launching a Specific Omega Floe Â¶ \n \n Click on the  Choose   input...  button, and the screen will navigate to your  My   Data  folder in the project data.\nSelect the  pyrrolamides_3D  file as input to the OMEGA - 3D Conformer Ensemble Generation floe. \n \n \n Figure 10: Selecting an Input Dataset Â¶ \n \n Click on the name  pyrrolamides_3D  to select that file, and then click the   icon to provide it as input\nto the floe.  You can leave the other parameters with their default values and click the   icon. \n \n The floe runs for only a few minutes, after which there is a new\ndatasetâthe set of conformersâin your data folder. \n \n \n \n Figure 11: Job Details for an Omega Floe Â¶ \n \n \n \n Figure 12: Output of an Omega Floe Â¶ \n \n 5. To prepare the receptor, click on the    icon, then select the file  3TTZ_A__receptor.oeb  at the location to\nwhich you downloaded it previously.  After another run of the File to Dataset Import floe, the receptor data are\npresent in the projectâs  My   Data  folder. \n \n \n Figure 13: Receptor Provided Â¶ \n \n We have provided the receptor file as a download in this tutorial, but more typically you might click on\nthe  Macro   Molecules \npage and get a receptor from a database such as  MMDS. \n \n Generate a binding site. \n \n Verify that the 3TTZ_A_receptor is now available in the  Active   Datasets  list on the  Project   Data  page. \n Click on the     icon next to the 3TTZ_A_receptor name. This adds the receptor\nto the  active dataset(s). \n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 14: Adding the Receptor to the Active Datasets List Â¶ \n \n \n Go to the  3D   Modeling  page and examine the binding site. \n \n \n \n To make the receptor and ligand visible, click on the Show/Hide icons for the receptor and the ligand 07N(A), respectively. \n \n \n \n \n Figure 15: Showing the Receptor and Ligand Â¶ \n \n \n Generate the Binding Site view: \n \n With receptor selected, \n With ligand 07N(A) selected, \n Click the Generate Binding Site icon ( ) \n \n You can control elements of the displayed binding site wih the  Binding   Site   Options  drop-down. (Click on the\nbar under the   icon.) For example,\nyou can uncheck  Show   Labels?  and then regenerate the binding site. \n \n \n \n \n Figure 16: Binding Site Options Â¶ \n \n \n \n Figure 17: A View of the Binding Site Â¶ \n \n \n Examine the protein-ligand interactions. The auto-interactions icon ( )\nhas a drop-down with additional display options. \n \n \n \n Figure 18: Interactions and Options Â¶ \n \n 10.

This matches what drconvert does.\nWhen writing records, if an incompatible type of data for a given field name is seen, the writer generates a new alternate field and stores the data in\nan alternate field rather than failing the writing process. \n \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the Home page when users first login to Orion. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A dedicated Organization Data project has been added. Data in this project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. In addition, the\nOrganization Data project is pre-populated with OpenEye-supplied data such as the Brood database, OpenEye-prepared third-party vendor collections for virtual screening,\ntutorial datasets, and other data that can be used as input to some of the included Orion Floes.  Note : The Organization Data project is only visible to Organization\nadmins in the list of projects in the Navbar and Home page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Organization admins now have control over the listing of projects on the Home page and Navbar on the Project Summary page. Organization admins can now toggle between\nâShow Allâ Organization projects and âShow Ownâ projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The Project Data page has been overhauled and now uses a folder-based file system for organizing your data, instead of a flat view. \n Within a project, data are organized into three main areas: \n \n \n My Data â your private data. No other users have access to this data. \n Team Data â data that are available to all project members. \n Shared Spaces â data that are available to select project members, i.e. shared data among the selected project members. \n \n \n \n New folders can be created from the Project Data page, when uploading data, and when launching a Floe from the Job Form. \n A dedicated Organization Data project is available to everyone in the Organization and is located above the Project Data folder hierarchy. Data in\nthis project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. \n The path to a desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders or when launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Folders and subfolders can be added to the  Favorite   Folders  space for quick and easy access. \n Data are now shared by creating a workspace in the âShared Foldersâ main folder. Permissions can be set for each user added to the workspace. \n Drag and drop functionality allows users to move collections, datasets, and/or files to the three main data areas, Trash can or other subfolders. \n String Search will search within the current folder or all project folders, i.e.,  My Data,  Team Data or Shared Spaces. \n Discussion boards Beta  can be created within a workspace to highlight and annotate data within that workspace, and can be viewed by all of that workspaceâs members. \n As part of the data migration, users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections. Collections now belong to projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n 3D Modeling Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer list is now record-focused. \n Badges to identify molecules, proteins and other components of datasets have been added to the 3D Viewer list. \n Tools for protein editing, including protonation state modification, capping terminal residues, and residue mutation have been added. \n When mutating protein residues, multiple residues can be selected and users can walk through applying a mutation to each residue in the selected set. \n Most of the small molecule editing tools can now be applied to proteins as well. \n The 3D molecule editor now contains the same set of molecular fragment templates as the 2D sketcher. \n An edited protein can be saved as a new dataset. \n A new receptor in OEDesignUnit (DU) display has been added. \n OEDesignUnit components can be edited and saved in place. \n Receptor ligands can be edited but not in place. Users need to make a copy of the ligand before editing.  Note : Receptor proteins cannot be edited. \n More options to save edited small molecules are now available. \n Users can edit datasets they donât own in place but need to save them to new datasets. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\n Project   Data  page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to the small molecule editing tools. \n Depiction tooltips in the list appear more reliably. \n \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to Data Handling. Users can now set the visibility for each column for each component of the user interface from the Data Handling dialog. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\nProject Data page. \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Spreadsheet fields now render correctly when users scroll to the right side of the spreadsheet. \n Layout issues when using multiple plots in trellis mode have been fixed. \n Molecules can now be sent to a Floe that takes a molecule fragment as input, for example, the Brood Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Selecting conformer points in the Scatter plot no longer fails intermittently. \n Saved color settings now persist. \n \n \n \n \n \n Floe User Interface Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n Support for a Job output folder path has been added to the Job Form. The default folder for Job output is âMy Dataâ, however, users can select\na different folder or create a new one. \n Job Cost alert and termination thresholds can now be set on the Job Form. The default values are inherited from the âMy Job Cost Limitsâ set\non the usersâ Profile page. Job Cost thresholds for any given job can be disabled by clearing the current value or setting the value to zero.\nThe values of these thresholds can be adjusted on the Job Status page after a job has been launched. \n Cubes in a running job are now colored specially when they are being throttled. More details are available in the Floe help. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n A bug has been fixed that caused Job parameters for jobs launched from the Orion command line interface (OCLI) from being displayed on the Job Status page. \n A bug that prevented the Job Form from opening for certain Floes has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n An issue that sometimes caused duplicate input or output parameters to appear in the Job Form has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Minor internal improvements have been made to  FastROCS ,  MaaS , and  MMDS . \n \n \n \n \n \n Admin Mode Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Options to customize Job Cost email alerts for Organization admins have been added. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

It also\nshows how to use an assortment of user interface features, such as examination of binding sites. \n DNA gyrase (GyrB) and topoisomerase IV (Topo IV) are clinically validated targets for the treatment of\nresistant bacterial infections. In a study carried out at a big Pharma, pyrrolamides were shown to exhibit\nantibacterial activity by competing with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in DNA gyrase and Topo IV. \n In this simulation, your role as the only modeler on the pyrrolamides optimization project\nis to guide the medicinal chemists\nin their design decisions; they want suggestions on what to synthesize next. Your ultimate goal is to help\nthem synthesize the depicted compound. \n \n \n Figure 1: Target Compound Â¶ \n \n You will explore  docking  in this retrospective study. In the drug discovery process, structure-based methods such\nas dockingâthe lock-and-key concept where the protein is the lock and the ligand is the keyâuse the structure of\na target protein to discover hits and optimize leads. In hit discovery or virtual screening, no molecules are\nknown that are active\nagainst the target protein. Docking is used to identify possible active molecules in a large molecule database,\nby examining their shapes and chemical complementarity to the active site. \n Datasets \n \n \n Initial ligands: pyrrolamides_3D.sdf â download the dataset below. \n Receptor: 3TTZ_A_receptor â download the receptor below. \n Conformer database â generate from pyrrolamides_3D dataset (see below). \n \n \n \n Download dataset of initial ligands \n pyrrolamides_3D.sdf \n \n \n Download receptor \n 3TTZ_A__receptor.oeb \n \n After completing this task, you will be able to: \n \n \n Upload datasets into  Orion \n Run an  Omega  floe \n Retrieve a receptor from a database \n Identify the binding pocket \n Perceive protein-ligand interactions \n Run a docking floe \n Analyze docking results in the  Analyze  page \n Perform a substructure search \n Add property data to a spreadsheet \n Sort the data in a spreadsheet \n Export data \n \n \n \n Navigate to the  Orion  Home page and create a project called âDocking Demo.â \n \n \n \n Figure 2.  By Default, Orion Switches to the New Project Automatically Â¶ \n \n \n Navigate to the  Data  (Project Data) page and upload the ligand file pyrrolamides_3D.sdf. \n \n \n \n Figure 3: Adding Data Â¶ \n \n \n \n Figure 4: Ready to Upload a File of Data Â¶ \n \n A dialog pops up showing that the upload is in progress, then a conversion floe, File to Dataset Import, runs quickly, producing a\ndataset from the uploaded file. \n You can see the recent notifications by clicking the  Notifications  icon ( ). \n \n \n Figure 5: Notification List Â¶ \n \n The end result is shown here. \n \n \n Figure 6: Requesting Job Details Â¶ \n \n The icon next to the job details on the upper right ( ) shows the job that produced the dataset.  A job is\nan instance of a workflow, or floe, in this case the format conversion floe File to Dataset Import. \n \n \n Figure 7: A Successfully Completed Job Â¶ \n \n Here, a File to Record Converter cube uploaded and converted the ligand file and then it fed its output to the Dataset Writer\ncube. \n \n Switch to the  Floe  (Workfloe) page, select the  OMEGA   -   3D   Conformer   Ensemble   Generation  Floe and generate ligand conformers. \n \n \n \n Figure 8: Listing Floes That Use Omega Â¶ \n \n \n \n Figure 9: Launching a Specific Omega Floe Â¶ \n \n Click on the  Choose   input...  button, and the screen will navigate to your  My   Data  folder in the project data.\nSelect the  pyrrolamides_3D  file as input to the OMEGA - 3D Conformer Ensemble Generation floe. \n \n \n Figure 10: Selecting an Input Dataset Â¶ \n \n Click on the name  pyrrolamides_3D  to select that file, and then click the   icon to provide it as input\nto the floe.  You can leave the other parameters with their default values and click the   icon. \n \n The floe runs for only a few minutes, after which there is a new\ndatasetâthe set of conformersâin your data folder. \n \n \n \n Figure 11: Job Details for an Omega Floe Â¶ \n \n \n \n Figure 12: Output of an Omega Floe Â¶ \n \n 5. To prepare the receptor, click on the    icon, then select the file  3TTZ_A__receptor.oeb  at the location to\nwhich you downloaded it previously.  After another run of the File to Dataset Import floe, the receptor data are\npresent in the projectâs  My   Data  folder. \n \n \n Figure 13: Receptor Provided Â¶ \n \n We have provided the receptor file as a download in this tutorial, but more typically you might click on\nthe  Macro   Molecules \npage and get a receptor from a database such as  MMDS. \n \n Generate a binding site. \n \n Verify that the 3TTZ_A_receptor is now available in the  Active   Datasets  list on the  Project   Data  page. \n Click on the     icon next to the 3TTZ_A_receptor name. This adds the receptor\nto the  active dataset(s). \n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 14: Adding the Receptor to the Active Datasets List Â¶ \n \n \n Go to the  3D   Modeling  page and examine the binding site. \n \n \n \n To make the receptor and ligand visible, click on the Show/Hide icons for the receptor and the ligand 07N(A), respectively. \n \n \n \n \n Figure 15: Showing the Receptor and Ligand Â¶ \n \n \n Generate the Binding Site view: \n \n With receptor selected, \n With ligand 07N(A) selected, \n Click the Generate Binding Site icon ( ) \n \n You can control elements of the displayed binding site wih the  Binding   Site   Options  drop-down. (Click on the\nbar under the   icon.)

Orion can be accessed either directly through\nthe customerâs relationship with AWS or indirectly through  OpenEye . \n Orion is an open platform that allows for straightforward integration of third-party code (i.e., from customers, academics, and vendors). The Orion\nfront end is a webpage, deliverable on any internet-enabled supported platform. \n \n Supported Browsers Â¶ \n \n \n Orion supports the most recent stable desktop versions of MozillaÂ® FirefoxÂ® and Google Chromeâ¢. \n \n \n \n Hint \n Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), Microsoft Edge, and macOS Safari are not supported. \n \n \n \n Supported Platforms Â¶ \n \n \n Windows \n macOS \n Linux \n Chrome OS \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n \n Orion organization admins can view user spending by project and user. \n Orion organization admins can see all projects and jobs from all users. \n Orion organization admins can only see project names but not the data in the projects. \n Non-admins can only see their own projects and the projects shared with them. \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n \n On Orionâs home page, users can view information about: \n \n \n projects \n recent jobs \n system status \n expenses \n RSS feeds \n A new userâs default project is created when the new user is added to the system. \n Non-admin usersâ projects are listed on an admin userâs Home page. \n Duplicate project names are not allowed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n \n Each project has its own Summary page. From the Project Summary page, users can: \n \n \n edit or delete projects \n add notes, molecular structures, and files \n add or remove project members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n \n Usersâ datasets, collections, and files are displayed on the Project data page. \n Files can be uploaded to the  Project   Data  page and converted to datasets, while datasets can be downloaded in the usual molecular formats. \n Admin users can share files and datasets with the entire organization. \n Collections can be filtered by name. \n Datasets can be copied and/or duplicated. \n Users can share multiple datasets to a project or with multiple recipients in one operation. \n Users can add or remove data tags. \n Datasets can be viewed using Card View. \n Columns are sortable in Card View. \n Individual molecules can be selected from the Card View to send to a Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n \n The Analyze pageâs features include: \n \n \n a molecular spreadsheet \n graphing capabilitiesâscatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and violin plots \n 2D and 3D viewing \n molecule subset creation \n filtering and tagging \n cheminformatics functionsâsubstructure search, R-group decomposition, and property calculation \n \n \n \n Molecules can be sent directly to FastROCS from the Analyze page. \n Molecules can be sent directly to a Floe using the Send to Workfloe feature. \n Users can add comments and ratings for molecules in the Analyze page and the 3D Viewer. \n Conformer data can be displayed in the spreadsheet and plot. \n Receptors are by default designated as â3D Onlyâ datasets, to keep them out of property calculations and the Analyze page. \n Users can turn on binning on a per-column basis. \n \n \n \n \n Floe UI Â¶ \n \n \n Users can upload packages containing Cubes and Floes. \n Packages can be searched by name. \n Floes can be shared with other users. \n The Floe Editor allows users to build a new Floe or edit an existing Floe. \n Users can place Cubes in a Cube group. \n Cube groups can be deleted. \n Running jobs can be monitored graphically. \n Jobs can be filtered by project and user (admin-only functionality). \n Parameters can be marked as âhiddenâ by the Floe author. \n Initializer ports are colored blue to make them visually different from other port types. \n Archive files (i.e., tar and zip files) are importable. \n \n \n \n \n 3D Viewer Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer includes functionality for perceiving protein and ligand interactions as well as for editing facilities for ligands in the context of the active site. \n Users can convert molecules from 2D to 3D in the 3D Viewer. \n Keyboard navigation can be used to cycle through conformers. \n Users can send molecules from MMDS directly to the 3D Viewer. \n Surfaces can be Z-clipped independently of other 3D objects. \n \n \n \n \n Iterative Design Â¶ \n \n \n Iterative Design has functionality that allows users to generate new analogs of existing compounds. Users can edit molecules in 2D or 3D. Additionally, users can\nchoose from the following algorithms: \n \n \n Matched Molecular Pairs (MMP) \n Near Fragment Replacement (NPR) \n Reagent Join (RJ) \n Explore Sidechains (ES) \n \n \n \n Iterative Design and molecule builder tasks run on their own servers. \n Property plots handle multiple pages of data. \n If necessary, entry into an Iterative Design session can be cancelled by the user. \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n \n Two data services are available: \n \n \n MacroMolecular Data Service (MMDS), a protein structure repository \n FastROCS, a method for retrieving all similar structures by shape and color (aligned chemical groups) from a database \n \n \n \n Users can send molecules directly to Orion from either data service. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

You can find links\nto them in this section and in relevant places elsewhere in this manual.  For a list of all tutorial videos,\nsee  Orion Video Tutorials . \n \n Data organization video Â¶ \n The features for organizing data have been revamped significantly.  For an introduction, try\nthis video:\n Data Organization in Orion . \n \n \n Discussion board videos Â¶ \n Discussion boards are a new user interface feature introduced in this version, accessed\nvia an icon on the  Project   Data  page:\n Introducing Discussion Boards \n We welcome your feedback on discussion boards after you have used them:\n Using Discussion Boards . \n For more about discussion boards, see  Discussion boards . \n \n \n 3D modeling videos Â¶ \n There are new badge and list features on the  3D   Modeling  page.\nHere is an introduction:  Badges and Lists in Orion . \n There are several more new videos about 3D modeling at  Orion Video Tutorials . \n \n \n \n Highlights Â¶ \n \n \n This release introduces a revamped  Project   Data  page which now uses a path- and folder-based file system for data organization. \n A desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders, or launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections as part of data migration. \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the  Home  page when users first login to Orion. \n Many enhancements have been made to  3D   Modeling  page, including several new tools for protein editing. \n Molecules, proteins, and other components of a dataset can now be identified using badges. \n Tooltips in the  3D   Viewer  have been enhanced. \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n A new discussion board Beta  feature is now available. \n This release introduces Orion stack protection through rate-limiting. \n Job cost email alerts can now be created. \n A dedicated  Organization   Data  project has been added. The data in this project are available to all Organization users and are prepopulated with\nOpenEye Data such as Collections used for virtual screening. \n New Floes have been added to  Floe  packages including: \n \n \n Non-Equilibrium Switching (NES) Floes in the MD Floe package. \n Cluster Poses, FastROCS,  and FreeForm Pose Floes in the Large-Scale-Floes package. \n Large-Scale Reaction Enumeration Floes in the Generative Design Floe package. \n \n \n \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types. \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Orion stack protection through rate-limiting has been implemented. \n Job cost email alerts are now available. Organization admins can set Job cost limits alerts for the entire organization on the Profile page. In addition, users can set\nJob cost limits alerts and Job termination thresholds for their own jobs on the Profile page. Job cost alerts can also be set prior to running a job on the Job Form.\nThese cost thresholds can be updated while a Job is running on the Job Status page. \n This release introduces a new Discussion Board Beta . Saved discussions may contain notes, images, or snapshot links of the 3D Modeling or Analyze pages.\nDiscussions are accessible to all team members. \n Substructure searching is now accessible from the databar filters. This functionality was previously available only on the Analyze page. \n Cubes which are being throttled now show up with special coloring. \n More information has been added to Job Debugging Data. \n A new instance-draining state has been added, which allows jobs to continue running but prevents new jobs from using the instance. \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types.\nFor new data being written to a dataset, it will be cast/coerced/promoted to the type of the existing dataset field. This matches what drconvert does.\nWhen writing records, if an incompatible type of data for a given field name is seen, the writer generates a new alternate field and stores the data in\nan alternate field rather than failing the writing process. \n \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the Home page when users first login to Orion. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A dedicated Organization Data project has been added. Data in this project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. In addition, the\nOrganization Data project is pre-populated with OpenEye-supplied data such as the Brood database, OpenEye-prepared third-party vendor collections for virtual screening,\ntutorial datasets, and other data that can be used as input to some of the included Orion Floes.  Note : The Organization Data project is only visible to Organization\nadmins in the list of projects in the Navbar and Home page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Organization admins now have control over the listing of projects on the Home page and Navbar on the Project Summary page. Organization admins can now toggle between\nâShow Allâ Organization projects and âShow Ownâ projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The Project Data page has been overhauled and now uses a folder-based file system for organizing your data, instead of a flat view. \n Within a project, data are organized into three main areas: \n \n \n My Data â your private data. No other users have access to this data. \n Team Data â data that are available to all project members. \n Shared Spaces â data that are available to select project members, i.e. shared data among the selected project members. \n \n \n \n New folders can be created from the Project Data page, when uploading data, and when launching a Floe from the Job Form. \n A dedicated Organization Data project is available to everyone in the Organization and is located above the Project Data folder hierarchy. Data in\nthis project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. \n The path to a desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders or when launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Folders and subfolders can be added to the  Favorite   Folders  space for quick and easy access. \n Data are now shared by creating a workspace in the âShared Foldersâ main folder. Permissions can be set for each user added to the workspace. \n Drag and drop functionality allows users to move collections, datasets, and/or files to the three main data areas, Trash can or other subfolders. \n String Search will search within the current folder or all project folders, i.e.,  My Data,  Team Data or Shared Spaces. \n Discussion boards Beta  can be created within a workspace to highlight and annotate data within that workspace, and can be viewed by all of that workspaceâs members. \n As part of the data migration, users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections. Collections now belong to projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n 3D Modeling Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer list is now record-focused. \n Badges to identify molecules, proteins and other components of datasets have been added to the 3D Viewer list. \n Tools for protein editing, including protonation state modification, capping terminal residues, and residue mutation have been added. \n When mutating protein residues, multiple residues can be selected and users can walk through applying a mutation to each residue in the selected set. \n Most of the small molecule editing tools can now be applied to proteins as well. \n The 3D molecule editor now contains the same set of molecular fragment templates as the 2D sketcher. \n An edited protein can be saved as a new dataset. \n A new receptor in OEDesignUnit (DU) display has been added. \n OEDesignUnit components can be edited and saved in place. \n Receptor ligands can be edited but not in place. Users need to make a copy of the ligand before editing.  Note : Receptor proteins cannot be edited. \n More options to save edited small molecules are now available. \n Users can edit datasets they donât own in place but need to save them to new datasets. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\n Project   Data  page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to the small molecule editing tools. \n Depiction tooltips in the list appear more reliably. \n \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to Data Handling. Users can now set the visibility for each column for each component of the user interface from the Data Handling dialog. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\nProject Data page. \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Spreadsheet fields now render correctly when users scroll to the right side of the spreadsheet. \n Layout issues when using multiple plots in trellis mode have been fixed. \n Molecules can now be sent to a Floe that takes a molecule fragment as input, for example, the Brood Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Selecting conformer points in the Scatter plot no longer fails intermittently. \n Saved color settings now persist. \n \n \n \n \n \n Floe User Interface Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n Support for a Job output folder path has been added to the Job Form. The default folder for Job output is âMy Dataâ, however, users can select\na different folder or create a new one. \n Job Cost alert and termination thresholds can now be set on the Job Form. The default values are inherited from the âMy Job Cost Limitsâ set\non the usersâ Profile page. Job Cost thresholds for any given job can be disabled by clearing the current value or setting the value to zero.\nThe values of these thresholds can be adjusted on the Job Status page after a job has been launched. \n Cubes in a running job are now colored specially when they are being throttled. More details are available in the Floe help. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n A bug has been fixed that caused Job parameters for jobs launched from the Orion command line interface (OCLI) from being displayed on the Job Status page. \n A bug that prevented the Job Form from opening for certain Floes has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n An issue that sometimes caused duplicate input or output parameters to appear in the Job Form has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Minor internal improvements have been made to  FastROCS ,  MaaS , and  MMDS . \n \n \n \n \n \n Admin Mode Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Options to customize Job Cost email alerts for Organization admins have been added. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Orion can be accessed either directly through\nthe customerâs relationship with AWS or indirectly through  OpenEye . \n Orion is an open platform that allows for straightforward integration of third-party code (i.e., from customers, academics, and vendors). The Orion\nfront end is a webpage, deliverable on any internet-enabled supported platform. \n \n Supported Browsers Â¶ \n \n \n Orion supports the most recent stable desktop versions of MozillaÂ® FirefoxÂ® and Google Chromeâ¢. \n \n \n \n Hint \n Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), Microsoft Edge, and macOS Safari are not supported. \n \n \n \n Supported Platforms Â¶ \n \n \n Windows \n macOS \n Linux \n Chrome OS \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n \n Orion organization admins can view user spending by project and user. \n Orion organization admins can see all projects and jobs from all users. \n Orion organization admins can only see project names but not the data in the projects. \n Non-admins can only see their own projects and the projects shared with them. \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n \n On Orionâs home page, users can view information about: \n \n \n projects \n recent jobs \n system status \n expenses \n RSS feeds \n A new userâs default project is created when the new user is added to the system. \n Non-admin usersâ projects are listed on an admin userâs Home page. \n Duplicate project names are not allowed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n \n Each project has its own Summary page. From the Project Summary page, users can: \n \n \n edit or delete projects \n add notes, molecular structures, and files \n add or remove project members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n \n Usersâ datasets, collections, and files are displayed on the Project data page. \n Files can be uploaded to the  Project   Data  page and converted to datasets, while datasets can be downloaded in the usual molecular formats. \n Admin users can share files and datasets with the entire organization. \n Collections can be filtered by name. \n Datasets can be copied and/or duplicated. \n Users can share multiple datasets to a project or with multiple recipients in one operation. \n Users can add or remove data tags. \n Datasets can be viewed using Card View. \n Columns are sortable in Card View. \n Individual molecules can be selected from the Card View to send to a Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n \n The Analyze pageâs features include: \n \n \n a molecular spreadsheet \n graphing capabilitiesâscatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and violin plots \n 2D and 3D viewing \n molecule subset creation \n filtering and tagging \n cheminformatics functionsâsubstructure search, R-group decomposition, and property calculation \n \n \n \n Molecules can be sent directly to FastROCS from the Analyze page. \n Molecules can be sent directly to a Floe using the Send to Workfloe feature. \n Users can add comments and ratings for molecules in the Analyze page and the 3D Viewer. \n Conformer data can be displayed in the spreadsheet and plot. \n Receptors are by default designated as â3D Onlyâ datasets, to keep them out of property calculations and the Analyze page. \n Users can turn on binning on a per-column basis. \n \n \n \n \n Floe UI Â¶ \n \n \n Users can upload packages containing Cubes and Floes. \n Packages can be searched by name. \n Floes can be shared with other users. \n The Floe Editor allows users to build a new Floe or edit an existing Floe. \n Users can place Cubes in a Cube group. \n Cube groups can be deleted. \n Running jobs can be monitored graphically. \n Jobs can be filtered by project and user (admin-only functionality). \n Parameters can be marked as âhiddenâ by the Floe author. \n Initializer ports are colored blue to make them visually different from other port types. \n Archive files (i.e., tar and zip files) are importable. \n \n \n \n \n 3D Viewer Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer includes functionality for perceiving protein and ligand interactions as well as for editing facilities for ligands in the context of the active site. \n Users can convert molecules from 2D to 3D in the 3D Viewer. \n Keyboard navigation can be used to cycle through conformers. \n Users can send molecules from MMDS directly to the 3D Viewer. \n Surfaces can be Z-clipped independently of other 3D objects. \n \n \n \n \n Iterative Design Â¶ \n \n \n Iterative Design has functionality that allows users to generate new analogs of existing compounds. Users can edit molecules in 2D or 3D. Additionally, users can\nchoose from the following algorithms: \n \n \n Matched Molecular Pairs (MMP) \n Near Fragment Replacement (NPR) \n Reagent Join (RJ) \n Explore Sidechains (ES) \n \n \n \n Iterative Design and molecule builder tasks run on their own servers. \n Property plots handle multiple pages of data. \n If necessary, entry into an Iterative Design session can be cancelled by the user. \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n \n Two data services are available: \n \n \n MacroMolecular Data Service (MMDS), a protein structure repository \n FastROCS, a method for retrieving all similar structures by shape and color (aligned chemical groups) from a database \n \n \n \n Users can send molecules directly to Orion from either data service. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Categories on\ncharts can be seen by moving the mouse cursor onto different parts of the\ngraph. \n \n Current Balance Â¶ \n This displays the current estimated running balance of this  Orion  account after subtracting Total Costs and adjusting for any credits. \n \n \n Date Range Â¶ \n This allows users to select the date range for displaying Total Costs and Credits. The default date range is seven days. \n \n \n AWS Total Costs Â¶ \n The usage table shows the estimated AWS costs for the date range selected and is broken down into the following categories: \n \n AWS Cost Breakdown Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n Example Cost \n \n \n \n Adjustments \n Orion  organization admin added expense. Usually added to reconcile the actual cost versus estimated cost. \n $0.00 \n \n Jobs \n Total user job costs on EC2 compute servers. \n $724.12 \n \n Storage Costs \n Per-user and bulk storage expense. Includes storage costs for collections, datasets, files, and temporary files. \n $452.32 \n \n Total \n The sum of all expenses. \n $1,176.44 \n \n Deposits \n Orion  organization admin added funds. \n $0.00 \n \n \n \n \n \n Downloadable Cost Data Â¶ \n With an OCLI command, a user can generate a comma-separated-value (CSV) file containing a breakdown\nof cost data.  If you are a Managed Service customer, see  the documentation on the ocli cost export command .\nSaaS customers can open a support request to obtain a copy of this CSV. \n \n \n Jobs Â¶ \n The job charts are categorized by user or project. Job costs account for the majority of the EC2\n(compute servers) portion of the costs seen in the AWS Cost Breakdown. \n \n \n Ledger Entries Â¶ \n Orion  provides estimates of an organizationâs current balance and allocates costs to users and\nprojects. Even if  Orion  is not used for a period of time, a cost is incurred for stored data. \n At the end of each job,  Orion  estimates its cost and adds an entry to the\norganization ledger. \n Storage ledger entries are added periodically on a per-user basis. These\nare calculated by summing the sizes of collections, datasets, files, and other\nobjects stored in S3 on behalf of users. \n Ledger entries include  OpenEye âs markup. \n \n Ledger Entry Types Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Credit \n Admin added funds \n \n Adjustment \n Admin added expense \n \n Storage \n Per-user incremental storage expense for collections, datasets, files, and floe packages \n \n Job \n Per-job EC2 expense \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

The Orion Platform release is now\ndecoupled from the Science Suites or Floe packages release. Science Suites now closely track the Apps and Toolkits releases. \n Floe Search functionality now searches by Floe title and Floe description. Title matches are listed before description matches. \n Floes are now sorted by title rather than by name. \n Discussion Boards can now be created and loaded directly from the  Analyze  and  3D   Modeling  pages. \n New icons have been introduced for collections  , datasets  , and files  . \n Read-only folders, collections, datasets, and files have special icons marked with a   icon. \n Shared Spaces can be identified by a   icon. \n Job cost notification now reports estimated job cost plus OpenEyeâs markup. \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Job cost notification now reports estimated job cost plus OpenEyeâs markup. \n The requirements for  finalize dataset  task have been increased to  cpu=1 ,  memory=1024.0 ,  disk_space=22000.0 . \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n A scheduler issue in Floe networking causing cyclic Floes to deadlock has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n A request to cancel a running rate-limited job sent from  Orion-client  is no longer throttled. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Documents and molecular files uploaded as âProject Filesâ are now placed in Team Data. No ETL Floes are run on these files. \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Edits of project descriptions can now be saved. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Collections, datasets, and files are now labeled with unique icons. A   icon depicts a collection, a  \nicon depicts a dataset, and a   icon depicts a file. \n Read-only folders, collections, datasets, and files have special icons marked with a   icon. For example, a read-only folder\nwill be denoted as  . \n Shared Spaces can be identified by a   icon. \n Dataset depictions are displayed faster. \n Shared spaces can now be deleted. \n Discussion Boards can now be moved between My Data and Shared Spaces. \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Moving a folder now moves the folder and all of its contents. \n A bug that limited the number of folders listed in the Path Selector when saving or moving datasets has been fixed.  Users can now load more folders, if they exist. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n An issue that caused the Active Data list to sometimes list search results instead of the active data has been fixed. \n Selecting âView Resultsâ on the  Jobs  page now searches all folders in the current project and displays all resource types. \n Searching for resources by Job Id on the  Project   Data  page could show those resources in the Trash and Active Data folders as well. This issue has been fixed. \n Moving a dataset from Active Data to another project now clears the data from Active Data. \n \n \n \n \n \n 3D Modeling Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Discussion Boards can now be created and loaded directly from the  3D   Modeling  page. \n Discussion Boards will throw a warning if a snapshot is missing datasets. \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Nucleic acids are displayed by default when they are part of a DesignUnit. \n When editing a protein, protein mutation tools now work properly. \n A ligand in a DesignUnit can now be edited without the associated protein. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n 3D Modeling snapshots in Discussion Boards now include grid contour information. \n Memory management improvements have been made to the  3D   Modeling  page. \n Deleting a pinned record now removes it from the Objects list. \n \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Discussion Boards can now be created and loaded directly from the  Analyze  page. \n Discussion Boards will throw a warning if a snapshot is missing datasets. \n Loading of data is now faster, particularly for smaller datasets and when filtering. \n The Databar has been restyled and now more prominently labels the number of active and total filters. \n Substructure filters now show the substructure with the filter. \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n An issue that caused some inconsistent vertical and/or horizontal scrolling behavior in the spreadsheet has been fixed. \n Binning of columns with the same name from different datasets now properly merges the data. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Pinned columns in the spreadsheet are now remembered. \n A bug that caused the spreadsheet scrollbar to sometimes disappear has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n Floe UI Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs page: \n \n \n Floe Search functionality now searches by Floe title and Floe description. Title matches are listed before description matches. \n Floes are now sorted by title rather than by name. \n SecretInputParameters are now supported in the UI. \n \n \n \n Floe Editor: \n \n \n R-groups and isotopes can now be set in the sketcher via a right-click on atoms. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Floe Editor: \n \n \n Parameters fixed in the Floe Editor can now be removed. \n The Start Job button in the Floe dialog could be disabled if a String parameter was\nrequired but had an empty string as a default. This issue has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Admin Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Ledger entries now load more quickly in Cost Accounting. \n \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n Minor internal improvements have been made to  FastROCS ,  MaaS , and  MMDS . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Saved discussions may contain notes, images, or snapshot links of the 3D Modeling or Analyze pages.\nDiscussions are accessible to all team members. \n Substructure searching is now accessible from the databar filters. This functionality was previously available only on the Analyze page. \n Cubes which are being throttled now show up with special coloring. \n More information has been added to Job Debugging Data. \n A new instance-draining state has been added, which allows jobs to continue running but prevents new jobs from using the instance. \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types.\nFor new data being written to a dataset, it will be cast/coerced/promoted to the type of the existing dataset field. This matches what drconvert does.\nWhen writing records, if an incompatible type of data for a given field name is seen, the writer generates a new alternate field and stores the data in\nan alternate field rather than failing the writing process. \n \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the Home page when users first login to Orion. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A dedicated Organization Data project has been added. Data in this project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. In addition, the\nOrganization Data project is pre-populated with OpenEye-supplied data such as the Brood database, OpenEye-prepared third-party vendor collections for virtual screening,\ntutorial datasets, and other data that can be used as input to some of the included Orion Floes.  Note : The Organization Data project is only visible to Organization\nadmins in the list of projects in the Navbar and Home page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Organization admins now have control over the listing of projects on the Home page and Navbar on the Project Summary page. Organization admins can now toggle between\nâShow Allâ Organization projects and âShow Ownâ projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The Project Data page has been overhauled and now uses a folder-based file system for organizing your data, instead of a flat view. \n Within a project, data are organized into three main areas: \n \n \n My Data â your private data. No other users have access to this data. \n Team Data â data that are available to all project members. \n Shared Spaces â data that are available to select project members, i.e. shared data among the selected project members. \n \n \n \n New folders can be created from the Project Data page, when uploading data, and when launching a Floe from the Job Form. \n A dedicated Organization Data project is available to everyone in the Organization and is located above the Project Data folder hierarchy. Data in\nthis project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. \n The path to a desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders or when launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Folders and subfolders can be added to the  Favorite   Folders  space for quick and easy access. \n Data are now shared by creating a workspace in the âShared Foldersâ main folder. Permissions can be set for each user added to the workspace. \n Drag and drop functionality allows users to move collections, datasets, and/or files to the three main data areas, Trash can or other subfolders. \n String Search will search within the current folder or all project folders, i.e.,  My Data,  Team Data or Shared Spaces. \n Discussion boards Beta  can be created within a workspace to highlight and annotate data within that workspace, and can be viewed by all of that workspaceâs members. \n As part of the data migration, users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections. Collections now belong to projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n 3D Modeling Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer list is now record-focused. \n Badges to identify molecules, proteins and other components of datasets have been added to the 3D Viewer list. \n Tools for protein editing, including protonation state modification, capping terminal residues, and residue mutation have been added. \n When mutating protein residues, multiple residues can be selected and users can walk through applying a mutation to each residue in the selected set. \n Most of the small molecule editing tools can now be applied to proteins as well. \n The 3D molecule editor now contains the same set of molecular fragment templates as the 2D sketcher. \n An edited protein can be saved as a new dataset. \n A new receptor in OEDesignUnit (DU) display has been added. \n OEDesignUnit components can be edited and saved in place. \n Receptor ligands can be edited but not in place. Users need to make a copy of the ligand before editing.  Note : Receptor proteins cannot be edited. \n More options to save edited small molecules are now available. \n Users can edit datasets they donât own in place but need to save them to new datasets. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\n Project   Data  page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to the small molecule editing tools. \n Depiction tooltips in the list appear more reliably. \n \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to Data Handling. Users can now set the visibility for each column for each component of the user interface from the Data Handling dialog. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\nProject Data page. \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Spreadsheet fields now render correctly when users scroll to the right side of the spreadsheet. \n Layout issues when using multiple plots in trellis mode have been fixed. \n Molecules can now be sent to a Floe that takes a molecule fragment as input, for example, the Brood Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Selecting conformer points in the Scatter plot no longer fails intermittently. \n Saved color settings now persist. \n \n \n \n \n \n Floe User Interface Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n Support for a Job output folder path has been added to the Job Form. The default folder for Job output is âMy Dataâ, however, users can select\na different folder or create a new one. \n Job Cost alert and termination thresholds can now be set on the Job Form. The default values are inherited from the âMy Job Cost Limitsâ set\non the usersâ Profile page. Job Cost thresholds for any given job can be disabled by clearing the current value or setting the value to zero.\nThe values of these thresholds can be adjusted on the Job Status page after a job has been launched. \n Cubes in a running job are now colored specially when they are being throttled. More details are available in the Floe help. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n A bug has been fixed that caused Job parameters for jobs launched from the Orion command line interface (OCLI) from being displayed on the Job Status page. \n A bug that prevented the Job Form from opening for certain Floes has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n An issue that sometimes caused duplicate input or output parameters to appear in the Job Form has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Minor internal improvements have been made to  FastROCS ,  MaaS , and  MMDS . \n \n \n \n \n \n Admin Mode Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Options to customize Job Cost email alerts for Organization admins have been added. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Orion can be accessed either directly through\nthe customerâs relationship with AWS or indirectly through  OpenEye . \n Orion is an open platform that allows for straightforward integration of third-party code (i.e., from customers, academics, and vendors). The Orion\nfront end is a webpage, deliverable on any internet-enabled supported platform. \n \n Supported Browsers Â¶ \n \n \n Orion supports the most recent stable desktop versions of MozillaÂ® FirefoxÂ® and Google Chromeâ¢. \n \n \n \n Hint \n Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), Microsoft Edge, and macOS Safari are not supported. \n \n \n \n Supported Platforms Â¶ \n \n \n Windows \n macOS \n Linux \n Chrome OS \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n \n Orion organization admins can view user spending by project and user. \n Orion organization admins can see all projects and jobs from all users. \n Orion organization admins can only see project names but not the data in the projects. \n Non-admins can only see their own projects and the projects shared with them. \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n \n On Orionâs home page, users can view information about: \n \n \n projects \n recent jobs \n system status \n expenses \n RSS feeds \n A new userâs default project is created when the new user is added to the system. \n Non-admin usersâ projects are listed on an admin userâs Home page. \n Duplicate project names are not allowed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n \n Each project has its own Summary page. From the Project Summary page, users can: \n \n \n edit or delete projects \n add notes, molecular structures, and files \n add or remove project members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n \n Usersâ datasets, collections, and files are displayed on the Project data page. \n Files can be uploaded to the  Project   Data  page and converted to datasets, while datasets can be downloaded in the usual molecular formats. \n Admin users can share files and datasets with the entire organization. \n Collections can be filtered by name. \n Datasets can be copied and/or duplicated. \n Users can share multiple datasets to a project or with multiple recipients in one operation. \n Users can add or remove data tags. \n Datasets can be viewed using Card View. \n Columns are sortable in Card View. \n Individual molecules can be selected from the Card View to send to a Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n \n The Analyze pageâs features include: \n \n \n a molecular spreadsheet \n graphing capabilitiesâscatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and violin plots \n 2D and 3D viewing \n molecule subset creation \n filtering and tagging \n cheminformatics functionsâsubstructure search, R-group decomposition, and property calculation \n \n \n \n Molecules can be sent directly to FastROCS from the Analyze page. \n Molecules can be sent directly to a Floe using the Send to Workfloe feature. \n Users can add comments and ratings for molecules in the Analyze page and the 3D Viewer. \n Conformer data can be displayed in the spreadsheet and plot. \n Receptors are by default designated as â3D Onlyâ datasets, to keep them out of property calculations and the Analyze page. \n Users can turn on binning on a per-column basis. \n \n \n \n \n Floe UI Â¶ \n \n \n Users can upload packages containing Cubes and Floes. \n Packages can be searched by name. \n Floes can be shared with other users. \n The Floe Editor allows users to build a new Floe or edit an existing Floe. \n Users can place Cubes in a Cube group. \n Cube groups can be deleted. \n Running jobs can be monitored graphically. \n Jobs can be filtered by project and user (admin-only functionality). \n Parameters can be marked as âhiddenâ by the Floe author. \n Initializer ports are colored blue to make them visually different from other port types. \n Archive files (i.e., tar and zip files) are importable. \n \n \n \n \n 3D Viewer Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer includes functionality for perceiving protein and ligand interactions as well as for editing facilities for ligands in the context of the active site. \n Users can convert molecules from 2D to 3D in the 3D Viewer. \n Keyboard navigation can be used to cycle through conformers. \n Users can send molecules from MMDS directly to the 3D Viewer. \n Surfaces can be Z-clipped independently of other 3D objects. \n \n \n \n \n Iterative Design Â¶ \n \n \n Iterative Design has functionality that allows users to generate new analogs of existing compounds. Users can edit molecules in 2D or 3D. Additionally, users can\nchoose from the following algorithms: \n \n \n Matched Molecular Pairs (MMP) \n Near Fragment Replacement (NPR) \n Reagent Join (RJ) \n Explore Sidechains (ES) \n \n \n \n Iterative Design and molecule builder tasks run on their own servers. \n Property plots handle multiple pages of data. \n If necessary, entry into an Iterative Design session can be cancelled by the user. \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n \n Two data services are available: \n \n \n MacroMolecular Data Service (MMDS), a protein structure repository \n FastROCS, a method for retrieving all similar structures by shape and color (aligned chemical groups) from a database \n \n \n \n Users can send molecules directly to Orion from either data service. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

The data in this project are available to all Organization users and are prepopulated with\nOpenEye Data such as Collections used for virtual screening. \n New Floes have been added to  Floe  packages including: \n \n \n Non-Equilibrium Switching (NES) Floes in the MD Floe package. \n Cluster Poses, FastROCS,  and FreeForm Pose Floes in the Large-Scale-Floes package. \n Large-Scale Reaction Enumeration Floes in the Generative Design Floe package. \n \n \n \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types. \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Orion stack protection through rate-limiting has been implemented. \n Job cost email alerts are now available. Organization admins can set Job cost limits alerts for the entire organization on the Profile page. In addition, users can set\nJob cost limits alerts and Job termination thresholds for their own jobs on the Profile page. Job cost alerts can also be set prior to running a job on the Job Form.\nThese cost thresholds can be updated while a Job is running on the Job Status page. \n This release introduces a new Discussion Board Beta . Saved discussions may contain notes, images, or snapshot links of the 3D Modeling or Analyze pages.\nDiscussions are accessible to all team members. \n Substructure searching is now accessible from the databar filters. This functionality was previously available only on the Analyze page. \n Cubes which are being throttled now show up with special coloring. \n More information has been added to Job Debugging Data. \n A new instance-draining state has been added, which allows jobs to continue running but prevents new jobs from using the instance. \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types.\nFor new data being written to a dataset, it will be cast/coerced/promoted to the type of the existing dataset field. This matches what drconvert does.\nWhen writing records, if an incompatible type of data for a given field name is seen, the writer generates a new alternate field and stores the data in\nan alternate field rather than failing the writing process. \n \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the Home page when users first login to Orion. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A dedicated Organization Data project has been added. Data in this project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. In addition, the\nOrganization Data project is pre-populated with OpenEye-supplied data such as the Brood database, OpenEye-prepared third-party vendor collections for virtual screening,\ntutorial datasets, and other data that can be used as input to some of the included Orion Floes.  Note : The Organization Data project is only visible to Organization\nadmins in the list of projects in the Navbar and Home page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Organization admins now have control over the listing of projects on the Home page and Navbar on the Project Summary page. Organization admins can now toggle between\nâShow Allâ Organization projects and âShow Ownâ projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The Project Data page has been overhauled and now uses a folder-based file system for organizing your data, instead of a flat view. \n Within a project, data are organized into three main areas: \n \n \n My Data â your private data. No other users have access to this data. \n Team Data â data that are available to all project members. \n Shared Spaces â data that are available to select project members, i.e. shared data among the selected project members. \n \n \n \n New folders can be created from the Project Data page, when uploading data, and when launching a Floe from the Job Form. \n A dedicated Organization Data project is available to everyone in the Organization and is located above the Project Data folder hierarchy. Data in\nthis project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. \n The path to a desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders or when launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Folders and subfolders can be added to the  Favorite   Folders  space for quick and easy access. \n Data are now shared by creating a workspace in the âShared Foldersâ main folder. Permissions can be set for each user added to the workspace. \n Drag and drop functionality allows users to move collections, datasets, and/or files to the three main data areas, Trash can or other subfolders. \n String Search will search within the current folder or all project folders, i.e.,  My Data,  Team Data or Shared Spaces. \n Discussion boards Beta  can be created within a workspace to highlight and annotate data within that workspace, and can be viewed by all of that workspaceâs members. \n As part of the data migration, users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections. Collections now belong to projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n 3D Modeling Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer list is now record-focused. \n Badges to identify molecules, proteins and other components of datasets have been added to the 3D Viewer list. \n Tools for protein editing, including protonation state modification, capping terminal residues, and residue mutation have been added. \n When mutating protein residues, multiple residues can be selected and users can walk through applying a mutation to each residue in the selected set. \n Most of the small molecule editing tools can now be applied to proteins as well. \n The 3D molecule editor now contains the same set of molecular fragment templates as the 2D sketcher. \n An edited protein can be saved as a new dataset. \n A new receptor in OEDesignUnit (DU) display has been added. \n OEDesignUnit components can be edited and saved in place. \n Receptor ligands can be edited but not in place. Users need to make a copy of the ligand before editing.  Note : Receptor proteins cannot be edited. \n More options to save edited small molecules are now available. \n Users can edit datasets they donât own in place but need to save them to new datasets. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\n Project   Data  page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to the small molecule editing tools. \n Depiction tooltips in the list appear more reliably. \n \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to Data Handling. Users can now set the visibility for each column for each component of the user interface from the Data Handling dialog. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\nProject Data page. \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Spreadsheet fields now render correctly when users scroll to the right side of the spreadsheet. \n Layout issues when using multiple plots in trellis mode have been fixed. \n Molecules can now be sent to a Floe that takes a molecule fragment as input, for example, the Brood Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Selecting conformer points in the Scatter plot no longer fails intermittently. \n Saved color settings now persist. \n \n \n \n \n \n Floe User Interface Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n Support for a Job output folder path has been added to the Job Form. The default folder for Job output is âMy Dataâ, however, users can select\na different folder or create a new one. \n Job Cost alert and termination thresholds can now be set on the Job Form. The default values are inherited from the âMy Job Cost Limitsâ set\non the usersâ Profile page. Job Cost thresholds for any given job can be disabled by clearing the current value or setting the value to zero.\nThe values of these thresholds can be adjusted on the Job Status page after a job has been launched. \n Cubes in a running job are now colored specially when they are being throttled. More details are available in the Floe help. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n A bug has been fixed that caused Job parameters for jobs launched from the Orion command line interface (OCLI) from being displayed on the Job Status page. \n A bug that prevented the Job Form from opening for certain Floes has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n An issue that sometimes caused duplicate input or output parameters to appear in the Job Form has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Minor internal improvements have been made to  FastROCS ,  MaaS , and  MMDS . \n \n \n \n \n \n Admin Mode Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Options to customize Job Cost email alerts for Organization admins have been added. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Currently,  FastROCS , MaaS (Molecules as a Service), and MacroMolecular Data Service (MMDS)\nare connected to  Orion , allowing users to seamlessly transfer molecules and protein structures between  Orion  and the data servers. \n \n \n FastROCS  is a method for retrieving all similar structures by shape and color (aligned chemical groups) using a GPU resource\nand a previously loaded database. \n MaaS allows searching of molecular databases containing billions of molecules in seconds.\nMaaS currently supports exact, fingerprint similarity, substructure, and title searches. Search output from MaaS\ncan be send directly to  Orion . \n MMDS is a protein structure repository. It allows for easy access to project structures, as well as  structures from a corporate collection\nor the PDB, each prepared previously by Orionâs Spruce function. If electron density is present, structures can be analyzed for quality\nby the Iridium criteria. Visualization of structures, ligand interactions, active site density, and crystal and biological unit partners are\nprovided. Selected structures can be retrieved as datasets for use in docking or structure-based design. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Collections, datasets, and raw data files are\naccessible here.  The data organization system implements familiar concepts of paths and folders\nto organize and access data in  Orion . \n The Programming Guide has additional technical details about data handling in Orion . \n \n Organizing and sharing data in folders Â¶ \n Users can organize the data according to the way they would like\nto share data among team members in a project. In addition, there are controlled data sharing\ncapabilities among members in the project. To achieve these objectives, the following main folders\nare available to users. \n \n My Data The data in this location are private and only\naccessible by the user. However, these data still can be shared by moving the data to a Shared\nSpace workspace. Data are put in My Data unless you specify otherwise in your upload. \n Only you can see the data until you share it to the Team or Shared folders. \n \n Team Data The data in this location are available to all project members. \n \n Shared Spaces The data in this location are available to the project members selected by the user. \n \n \n \n Orion provides automatic intraspection of files: hovering gives a depiction of the\nfirst structure if the file contains small molecules, or a protein schematic if amino acids\nare present. Selecting one or more datasets creates an active dataset. Active datasets are\ncarried forward to any feature domain (for example, moving to the Analyze page automatically\npopulates the spreadsheet). The  Project   Data  page also shows which filters are currently\napplied to the active data. \n \n Project Data Page Layout Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Add Data  button \n Allows users to add data by uploading files,  sketching , or importing a biomolecule. \n \n Search \n Allows users to search for collections, datasets, or files by name or tag. \n \n Show  drop-down \n Allows users to show any assortment of collections, datasets, and files. \n \n Sort by  drop-down \n Allows users sort by one of several options. \n \n Datasets Table \n Lists project datasets, sorted as specified by the  Sort   by:  drop-down. \n \n Trash Can \n Repository for deleted datasets. To restore the dataset, click on the Trash Can, select the dataset, and drag it to the\nappropriate folder. \n \n \n \n \n Tile View Â¶ \n Another form of intraspection is available for small molecule files: the tile view. Activate the tile view by\nclicking the   icon to the left of a dataset name.\nOn completion of the browsing of structures, click  Cancel , and you will be returned to the originating page. \n \n The tile view displays a panel list of structures in 2D or 3D, with associated\nproperties. It can be configured to display single structures, a side-by-side view, a grid compare view, or a grid view.\nEntries can be sorted by properties selected from all those available within the dataset.\nThe tile view is designed for fast traversal; selected structures can form the basis of a selected set on leaving\nthe page. \n \n \n What actions do I need to take if I had an account on a pre-2021 version of Orion? Â¶ \n If you have a pre-2021  Orion  account, you\nwill need to take some action on the shared data from previous  Orion  versions. \n \n Decide how to organize the data. \n Move all previously shared items into the appropriate folders. \n Assign collections to a project. \n \n \n AWS Representation \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can. Anything in the\nTrash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. \n In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ\noption. Please consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n \n Searching for data Â¶ \n You can search for datasets by entering a tag or resource name in the search\nbar. Select the main folder or space you would like to search. Next, enter the tag\nor resource name and click on that name. Then, the results will be shown at the bottom\nof the page. In addition, you will be able to see the path where this data can be\nfound. \n \n \n Uploading data Â¶ \n You can specify a path when uploading a file into  Orion . To specify a path,\nselect the folder or subfolders as applicable. Alternatively, you can go up a\ndirectory by clicking on the up arrow or using the backspace key.\nAlso, you can create a new subfolder by entering the name and then\nclicking on  Create   a   new   folder . \n \n CXSMILES Data Â¶ \n Data can be uploaded in CXSMILES format. (Data/My Data/+Add Data/Uploadâ¦.) \n \n \n \n Downloading and Exporting Data Â¶ \n You can download data, and it will be converted to a canonical format if necessary. \n \n Select dataset > More Actions > Export. \n In the Export pop-up, choose your preferred file format, then click Export. \n In the notification panel, you can check the status of your exports. \n After download, optionally move or delete the exported file from My Data Exports. \n \n \n \n Deleting data Â¶ \n To delete data, first select the data you want to delete\nby clicking on the square box on the left side to the folder or subfolder name.\nNext, click the   icon on the far right or in the top menu.\nMultiple data can be selected and deleted at once. Then, these data will be\nmoved to the  Trash  space. The items in the trash will be automatically deleted after\n30 days. \n \n \n Preserving Data of a Removed User Â¶ \n Customers can open a support request to remove a user from an organization, which\ntransfers ownership of that userâs data to project owners or an organization administrator. \n \n \n Subfolders Â¶ \n To create a new subfolder, first select the place\n( My   Data ,  Team   Data  or  Shared   Spaces ) where you want to create a new subfolder.\nThen, click on the   icon next to the path (example:\nMy Data). In the pop-up window, enter the\nfolder name and click  OK . A new subfolder will be created\nwith the specified name in the selected path. \n You can create a new folder or subfolder in the same window you use to\nupload data or when starting a floe run. To do this,\nselect the path and then enter the name of the\nsubfolder you want to create. A green bar\nwill appear with  Create   a   new   folder  next to the\nsubfolder name you just entered. Click on  Create   a \n new   folder . A new folder or subfolder will show up\non the path specified. \n \n Favorite subfolders Â¶ \n To quickly access a subfolder, you can mark it as a favorite by clicking\non the  star  next to the folder, and it will be added to the  Favorite   Folders  area in the left side column. \n \n \n Deleting subfolders Â¶ \n To delete a subfolder, select the subfolder you want to\ndelete and click on the   icon. The subfolder and all the contents in this\nsubfolder will be moved to the Trash space. The items in the trash will be automatically\ndeleted after 30 days. \n \n \n Moving a subfolder Â¶ \n A subfolder can be moved to another path or location. To do this, select the folder you\nwould like to move, and click either the bi-directional line icon on top or the ellipsis\nicon, and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path and click the  Move  button.\nThe subfolder (and its contents) will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n \n Video tutorial about project data Â¶ \n For more information on the use of the project data\nfacilities,  see the tutorial video . \n \n Note \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can.\nAnything in the Trash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ option.\nPlease consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n Moving data between projects Â¶ \n Data (datasets, files and collections) can be moved between projects, folders or subfolders.\nTo do this, select the data you would like to move and click the bi-directional line icon or\nthe ellipsis ( ... ) icon and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path, and click\nthe  Move  button. The selected data will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n Collection Metadata Â¶ \n Some collections feature an information icon ( ) that displays pregenerated metadata about the collection. The\ninformation may be helpful in working with collections, because you can see the metadata immediately, without having\nto run a floe. \n \n \n \n \n \n Discussion boards Â¶ \n You often need not only to share data with team members but also to discuss the results\nwith them. \n Discussion boards are accessed by the âchatâ icon ( ) on the  Project   Data  page. If you select the\nicon, you get a display on the right side of the screen that will be familiar from\nother chat experiences you have used. \n You can share links and images along with text comments, and discussions are preserved\nso you can revisit them.  The discussion board  autosaves usersâ edits. \n For an introduction, see this training video: Introducing Discussion Boards \n You can see further information in this training video: Using Discussion Boards . \n \n \n Shared spaces Â¶ \n To share data, use the  Shared   Spaces  main folder (or space). \n You can start by creating a workspace in  Shared   Spaces . Click on the  +  icon\nnext to the path. A pop-up window named  Workspace   name  will appear. Enter the\nname of the workspace you want to create and click  OK . \n A new subfolder with the\nspecified name will show in the Shared Spaces. If you click on this workspace,\nthen you will have the option to add members with whom you want to share the data. \n Click on the   icon and then click on  Edit   Users . Enter the name of the\nuser/project member you want to add. In this window, you will have the option\nto set the permissions (write, delete) you want for that user to have.  All the\ndata in this workspace will be shared with the selected users/project members. \n Alternatively, if you would like all project members to have access to the data,\nsave the data in the  Team   Data  space. \n The items ( workspaces ) in  Shared   Spaces  resemble folders, but they are actually file systems in their own right.  The user interface\nenforces the differences between workspaces and folders. \n \n Note \n With folders, access to data by others is determined by the folder you choose to use.  For example, things in the  Team   Data  folder\nare accessible to all members of the project team. For the workspaces within  Shared   Spaces , you can define a subset of users who have access to the workspace\nand its data.  You can pick the users by use of the   icon. \n \n \n Move, Drag-and-Drop The user interface does not show these actions for workspaces in the list of workspaces because they cannot be performed. \n \n Create and Rename and Delete You can perform these actions on workspaces. \n \n Inside a workspace Folders created within a workspace behave as other folders do. \n \n \n \n \n Workspace with contents Â¶ \n \n \n \n List of workspaces Â¶ \n \n \n \n Organization Data Page Â¶ \n \n \n Data available to an organization Â¶ \n \n The  Organization   Data  space allows for\nadmin users to share datasets and collections with the entire organization. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder\nof the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with\nthe compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs\nto use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process,\nor makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified\nlater version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with\nGCC in accord with the license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable\nform or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code\ndoes not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a\ncompiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written\ncode, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and\npreprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood\nas starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is\ndone without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate\nrepresentations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules,\neven if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by\nEligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the\nlicensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by\nthe copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.\n \n \n \n See also \n \n http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception.html \n \n \n \n \n GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Â¶ \n                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                     Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                          Preamble\n\n The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\n software and other kinds of works.\n\n   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\n to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\n the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n your programs, too.\n\n   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\n know their rights.\n\n   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n authors of previous versions.\n\n   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n modification follow.\n\n                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   0. Definitions.\n\n   \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n   \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n   \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\n exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\n earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n on the Program.\n\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\n permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\n distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\n public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\n a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n   An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\n to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\n the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n   1. Source Code.\n\n   The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\n for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\n form of a work.\n\n   A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\n standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\n is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n   The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\n than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n   The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\n the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\n System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\n which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\n includes interface definition files associated with source files for\n the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\n linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\n such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\n subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n Source.\n\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\n same work.\n\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\n covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\n rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n makes it unnecessary.\n\n   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n measures.\n\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n technological measures.\n\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\n recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\n in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\n parts of the aggregate.\n\n   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\n machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\n in one of these ways:\n\n   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n   Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n   customarily used for software interchange.\n\n   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n   written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n   long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n   model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n   copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n   product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n   medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n   more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n   conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n   Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n   written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n   alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n   only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n   with subsection 6b.\n\n   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n   place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n   Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n   further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n   Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n   copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n   may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n   that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n   clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n   Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n   Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n   available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n   you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n   Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n   charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\n restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n where to find the applicable terms.\n\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n the above requirements apply either way.\n\n   8. Termination.\n\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n paragraph of section 11).\n\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\n holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n your receipt of the notice.\n\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\n material under section 10.\n\n   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\n for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n   An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\n organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\n not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n   11. Patents.\n\n   A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\n work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n   A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\n owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\n by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\n consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\n purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\n patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\n this License.\n\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\n make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\n propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\n agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\n party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n patent against the party.\n\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\n publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\n then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\n available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\n consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\n license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\n actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\n in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n work and works based on it.\n\n   A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\n the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\n work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\n in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\n to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\n covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\n the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\n combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\n License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\n but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n combination as such.\n\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\n the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n address new problems or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\n Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\n Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\n option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\n version or of any later version published by the Free Software\n Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\n GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\n by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\n public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\n to choose that version for the Program.\n\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different\n permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\n author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\n later version.\n\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\n HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\n OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\n THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\n IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\n ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\n THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\n USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\n DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\n PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\n EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\n above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\n reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\n an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\n Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\n copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n     (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n     GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\n notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\n The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\n parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\n might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\n if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\n For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\n into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\n may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\n the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\n Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n \n \n \n See also \n \n http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

All panes can be moved, removed, resized, or duplicated.\nThere are two views: a spreadsheet view and a 3D analysis view. \n The graphing feature can represent data with five different variables, some categorical and some continuous, via the choice of\npoint shapes, size, color, and their x and y values. Scatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and violin plots are\navailable, where appropriate, for the selected data type(s). Multiple graphs can be created. Points can be selected by lasso\nor by point-and-click. Depictions of structures can be accessed for any selected points. The graph can be moved, panned,\nor reset. Scales can be changed between linear to log forms. Regression lines (with error bars) can be added. Box plots\ncontain quartile ranges and other annotations. \n \n \n Figure 1.  When a point in the plot is selected, the spreadsheet navigates to the row representing that point. You can also select a row in the spreadsheet\nand see the corresponding point identified in the plot. Â¶ \n \n \n Spreadsheet Â¶ \n The spreadsheet allows typical actions: column sorting, pinning, reordering or deleting, and\nindication of selected rows.\nPop-up views of structures are also available. The spreadsheet data can be manipulated by\na data-handling panel that allows\ncolumns to be turned on or off. It also allows for a style to be chosen for treating imprecise\ndata (for example, ranges, inequalities, multiple values). \n JSON  data fields are viewable in the spreadsheet. \n Categorical string fields can  be filtered using a âfree textâ setting. This allows\ncreation of filters that can match multiple distinct categorical values that contain a\nprovided string. \n \n \n Figure 2.  Spreadsheet cells can be copied to the system clipboard. Â¶ \n \n \n \n Components of the Analyze Page Â¶ \n \n Analyze Page Layout Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Graphing Panel \n \n Allows users to create plots. The plot type (scatter, boxplot, heatmap, \n histogram, or violin) can be selected from the Plot drop-down menu. \n \n \n \n Spreadsheet \n \n Displays imported data, molecular structures, and images. Users can append \n calculated properties, such as PSA and XLogP. \n \n \n \n Data & Columns Panel \n \n Allows users to compute molecular properties, perform R-Group decomposition, \n and predict properties using a regression model. \n \n \n \n Layout Drop-down \n \n Allows 3D viewing with the  Analyze   with   3D  mode. \n \n \n \n Job History \n \n Displays a summary of running and recent jobs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hint \n Saved Views  allow users to save the current state  of the Analyze page,\nswitch to another page or task, and then come back to exactly the same state.\nThe  Data   Handling  control allows users to apply column settings to all data columns of the\nsame name. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

For an introduction, try\nthis video:\n Data Organization in Orion . \n \n \n Discussion board videos Â¶ \n Discussion boards are a new user interface feature introduced in this version, accessed\nvia an icon on the  Project   Data  page:\n Introducing Discussion Boards \n We welcome your feedback on discussion boards after you have used them:\n Using Discussion Boards . \n For more about discussion boards, see  Discussion boards . \n \n \n 3D modeling videos Â¶ \n There are new badge and list features on the  3D   Modeling  page.\nHere is an introduction:  Badges and Lists in Orion . \n There are several more new videos about 3D modeling at  Orion Video Tutorials . \n \n \n \n Highlights Â¶ \n \n \n This release introduces a revamped  Project   Data  page which now uses a path- and folder-based file system for data organization. \n A desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders, or launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections as part of data migration. \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the  Home  page when users first login to Orion. \n Many enhancements have been made to  3D   Modeling  page, including several new tools for protein editing. \n Molecules, proteins, and other components of a dataset can now be identified using badges. \n Tooltips in the  3D   Viewer  have been enhanced. \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n A new discussion board Beta  feature is now available. \n This release introduces Orion stack protection through rate-limiting. \n Job cost email alerts can now be created. \n A dedicated  Organization   Data  project has been added. The data in this project are available to all Organization users and are prepopulated with\nOpenEye Data such as Collections used for virtual screening. \n New Floes have been added to  Floe  packages including: \n \n \n Non-Equilibrium Switching (NES) Floes in the MD Floe package. \n Cluster Poses, FastROCS,  and FreeForm Pose Floes in the Large-Scale-Floes package. \n Large-Scale Reaction Enumeration Floes in the Generative Design Floe package. \n \n \n \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types. \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Orion stack protection through rate-limiting has been implemented. \n Job cost email alerts are now available. Organization admins can set Job cost limits alerts for the entire organization on the Profile page. In addition, users can set\nJob cost limits alerts and Job termination thresholds for their own jobs on the Profile page. Job cost alerts can also be set prior to running a job on the Job Form.\nThese cost thresholds can be updated while a Job is running on the Job Status page. \n This release introduces a new Discussion Board Beta . Saved discussions may contain notes, images, or snapshot links of the 3D Modeling or Analyze pages.\nDiscussions are accessible to all team members. \n Substructure searching is now accessible from the databar filters. This functionality was previously available only on the Analyze page. \n Cubes which are being throttled now show up with special coloring. \n More information has been added to Job Debugging Data. \n A new instance-draining state has been added, which allows jobs to continue running but prevents new jobs from using the instance. \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types.\nFor new data being written to a dataset, it will be cast/coerced/promoted to the type of the existing dataset field. This matches what drconvert does.\nWhen writing records, if an incompatible type of data for a given field name is seen, the writer generates a new alternate field and stores the data in\nan alternate field rather than failing the writing process. \n \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the Home page when users first login to Orion. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A dedicated Organization Data project has been added. Data in this project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. In addition, the\nOrganization Data project is pre-populated with OpenEye-supplied data such as the Brood database, OpenEye-prepared third-party vendor collections for virtual screening,\ntutorial datasets, and other data that can be used as input to some of the included Orion Floes.  Note : The Organization Data project is only visible to Organization\nadmins in the list of projects in the Navbar and Home page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Organization admins now have control over the listing of projects on the Home page and Navbar on the Project Summary page. Organization admins can now toggle between\nâShow Allâ Organization projects and âShow Ownâ projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The Project Data page has been overhauled and now uses a folder-based file system for organizing your data, instead of a flat view. \n Within a project, data are organized into three main areas: \n \n \n My Data â your private data. No other users have access to this data. \n Team Data â data that are available to all project members. \n Shared Spaces â data that are available to select project members, i.e. shared data among the selected project members. \n \n \n \n New folders can be created from the Project Data page, when uploading data, and when launching a Floe from the Job Form. \n A dedicated Organization Data project is available to everyone in the Organization and is located above the Project Data folder hierarchy. Data in\nthis project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. \n The path to a desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders or when launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Folders and subfolders can be added to the  Favorite   Folders  space for quick and easy access. \n Data are now shared by creating a workspace in the âShared Foldersâ main folder. Permissions can be set for each user added to the workspace. \n Drag and drop functionality allows users to move collections, datasets, and/or files to the three main data areas, Trash can or other subfolders. \n String Search will search within the current folder or all project folders, i.e.,  My Data,  Team Data or Shared Spaces. \n Discussion boards Beta  can be created within a workspace to highlight and annotate data within that workspace, and can be viewed by all of that workspaceâs members. \n As part of the data migration, users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections. Collections now belong to projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n 3D Modeling Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer list is now record-focused. \n Badges to identify molecules, proteins and other components of datasets have been added to the 3D Viewer list. \n Tools for protein editing, including protonation state modification, capping terminal residues, and residue mutation have been added. \n When mutating protein residues, multiple residues can be selected and users can walk through applying a mutation to each residue in the selected set. \n Most of the small molecule editing tools can now be applied to proteins as well. \n The 3D molecule editor now contains the same set of molecular fragment templates as the 2D sketcher. \n An edited protein can be saved as a new dataset. \n A new receptor in OEDesignUnit (DU) display has been added. \n OEDesignUnit components can be edited and saved in place. \n Receptor ligands can be edited but not in place. Users need to make a copy of the ligand before editing.  Note : Receptor proteins cannot be edited. \n More options to save edited small molecules are now available. \n Users can edit datasets they donât own in place but need to save them to new datasets. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\n Project   Data  page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to the small molecule editing tools. \n Depiction tooltips in the list appear more reliably. \n \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to Data Handling. Users can now set the visibility for each column for each component of the user interface from the Data Handling dialog. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\nProject Data page. \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Spreadsheet fields now render correctly when users scroll to the right side of the spreadsheet. \n Layout issues when using multiple plots in trellis mode have been fixed. \n Molecules can now be sent to a Floe that takes a molecule fragment as input, for example, the Brood Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Selecting conformer points in the Scatter plot no longer fails intermittently. \n Saved color settings now persist. \n \n \n \n \n \n Floe User Interface Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n Support for a Job output folder path has been added to the Job Form. The default folder for Job output is âMy Dataâ, however, users can select\na different folder or create a new one. \n Job Cost alert and termination thresholds can now be set on the Job Form. The default values are inherited from the âMy Job Cost Limitsâ set\non the usersâ Profile page. Job Cost thresholds for any given job can be disabled by clearing the current value or setting the value to zero.\nThe values of these thresholds can be adjusted on the Job Status page after a job has been launched. \n Cubes in a running job are now colored specially when they are being throttled. More details are available in the Floe help. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n A bug has been fixed that caused Job parameters for jobs launched from the Orion command line interface (OCLI) from being displayed on the Job Status page. \n A bug that prevented the Job Form from opening for certain Floes has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n An issue that sometimes caused duplicate input or output parameters to appear in the Job Form has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Minor internal improvements have been made to  FastROCS ,  MaaS , and  MMDS . \n \n \n \n \n \n Admin Mode Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Options to customize Job Cost email alerts for Organization admins have been added. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Floes are constructed of cubes, which are small programming elements. Floes and cubes\nare uploaded and incorporated into  Orion  as tar packages or docker images. (See  the development instructions\nin the Programming Guide for more information about packaging .) When loaded, floes can be\nshared like any other dataset. Uploaded\nfloes are found in and run from the  Floes  tab and the  Editor  tab.\nIn the  Floes  tab, they can also be assigned to other feature domains. \n \n When a floe is launched, its progress can be\nfollowed graphically and in real time.  A floe in progress is shown in the  Jobs  tab, with different\ncolors indicating the status of the cubes. \n \n \n Figure 1. A Floe in Progress Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n A cost analysis is available before, during, and after each\nfloe. After each floe completes, a notification is posted that can be viewed by clicking the  Notifications  icon ( ).\n(When you launch a floe, or in your profile, you can also ask to receive an email when a job completes.)   The job\nmay also produce output datasets or an\nHTML report file. A log file of the floe job is also presented. \n Job cost alerts can be set globally for all floe runs in the Profile section.\nUsers can modify job cost thresholds in the Job Form before launching a floe and during the run. \n \n Specify a Path when Launching a Floe Run Â¶ \n A path or location can be specified in the job\nsubmission form. When launching a floe run, you will see an\n Output   path  property field. The default path will be\n Project   Name/My   Data . You can type in a new directory name,\nwhich will be created when the output is written. To go up a directory, click on\nthe up arrow or use the backspace key to move up one\ndirectory. Finally, select the path you want. \n \n \n Find a Floe in Orion Â¶ \n You can find a particular floe, out of the many available, using the  Floe  page with these techniques: \n \n Navigate to the floe using the categories in the left-hand pane. \n \n The  Created   in   Floe   Editor  category shows floes that do not have an associated package and thus were likely\ncreated in the  Editor .   See the Programming Guide for more information about the Floe\nEditor . \n The  Packages  category groups floes according to the packages in which they are built.  You may be familiar\nwith this nomenclature from past releases.  For example, selecting the package  OpenEye  Biomodeler Floes in the\ndrop-down displays the floes associated with that package. \n The  Product-based  category corresponds to the names of  OpenEye  products, such as  BROOD .  This\ncategory is one deep: if you select  BROOD , you will get the list of floes associated with that product, displayed\nin the right-hand pane. \n The  Role-based ,  Solution-based , and  Task-based  categories are deeper, meaning you might go through\none or more subcategories to get to a specific list of floes. \n \n \n Search for the floe using the search bar labeled âSearch Floes and Categoriesâ in the right-hand pane.  This search looks for\nthe search term among the category terms and in the brief description of the floe.  The brief appears in a list of\nfloes; it is not the longer description that appears when you display an individual floe.\nThe search should give you a concise list of relevant floes. \n \n \n \n Figure 2.

You can find links\nto them in this section and in relevant places elsewhere in this manual.  For a list of all tutorial videos,\nsee  Orion Video Tutorials . \n \n Data organization video Â¶ \n The features for organizing data have been revamped significantly.  For an introduction, try\nthis video:\n Data Organization in Orion . \n \n \n Discussion board videos Â¶ \n Discussion boards are a new user interface feature introduced in this version, accessed\nvia an icon on the  Project   Data  page:\n Introducing Discussion Boards \n We welcome your feedback on discussion boards after you have used them:\n Using Discussion Boards . \n For more about discussion boards, see  Discussion boards . \n \n \n 3D modeling videos Â¶ \n There are new badge and list features on the  3D   Modeling  page.\nHere is an introduction:  Badges and Lists in Orion . \n There are several more new videos about 3D modeling at  Orion Video Tutorials . \n \n \n \n Highlights Â¶ \n \n \n This release introduces a revamped  Project   Data  page which now uses a path- and folder-based file system for data organization. \n A desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders, or launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections as part of data migration. \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the  Home  page when users first login to Orion. \n Many enhancements have been made to  3D   Modeling  page, including several new tools for protein editing. \n Molecules, proteins, and other components of a dataset can now be identified using badges. \n Tooltips in the  3D   Viewer  have been enhanced. \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n A new discussion board Beta  feature is now available. \n This release introduces Orion stack protection through rate-limiting. \n Job cost email alerts can now be created. \n A dedicated  Organization   Data  project has been added. The data in this project are available to all Organization users and are prepopulated with\nOpenEye Data such as Collections used for virtual screening. \n New Floes have been added to  Floe  packages including: \n \n \n Non-Equilibrium Switching (NES) Floes in the MD Floe package. \n Cluster Poses, FastROCS,  and FreeForm Pose Floes in the Large-Scale-Floes package. \n Large-Scale Reaction Enumeration Floes in the Generative Design Floe package. \n \n \n \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types. \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Orion stack protection through rate-limiting has been implemented. \n Job cost email alerts are now available. Organization admins can set Job cost limits alerts for the entire organization on the Profile page. In addition, users can set\nJob cost limits alerts and Job termination thresholds for their own jobs on the Profile page. Job cost alerts can also be set prior to running a job on the Job Form.\nThese cost thresholds can be updated while a Job is running on the Job Status page. \n This release introduces a new Discussion Board Beta . Saved discussions may contain notes, images, or snapshot links of the 3D Modeling or Analyze pages.\nDiscussions are accessible to all team members. \n Substructure searching is now accessible from the databar filters. This functionality was previously available only on the Analyze page. \n Cubes which are being throttled now show up with special coloring. \n More information has been added to Job Debugging Data. \n A new instance-draining state has been added, which allows jobs to continue running but prevents new jobs from using the instance. \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types.\nFor new data being written to a dataset, it will be cast/coerced/promoted to the type of the existing dataset field. This matches what drconvert does.\nWhen writing records, if an incompatible type of data for a given field name is seen, the writer generates a new alternate field and stores the data in\nan alternate field rather than failing the writing process. \n \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the Home page when users first login to Orion. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A dedicated Organization Data project has been added. Data in this project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. In addition, the\nOrganization Data project is pre-populated with OpenEye-supplied data such as the Brood database, OpenEye-prepared third-party vendor collections for virtual screening,\ntutorial datasets, and other data that can be used as input to some of the included Orion Floes.  Note : The Organization Data project is only visible to Organization\nadmins in the list of projects in the Navbar and Home page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Organization admins now have control over the listing of projects on the Home page and Navbar on the Project Summary page. Organization admins can now toggle between\nâShow Allâ Organization projects and âShow Ownâ projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The Project Data page has been overhauled and now uses a folder-based file system for organizing your data, instead of a flat view. \n Within a project, data are organized into three main areas: \n \n \n My Data â your private data. No other users have access to this data. \n Team Data â data that are available to all project members. \n Shared Spaces â data that are available to select project members, i.e. shared data among the selected project members. \n \n \n \n New folders can be created from the Project Data page, when uploading data, and when launching a Floe from the Job Form. \n A dedicated Organization Data project is available to everyone in the Organization and is located above the Project Data folder hierarchy. Data in\nthis project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. \n The path to a desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders or when launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Folders and subfolders can be added to the  Favorite   Folders  space for quick and easy access. \n Data are now shared by creating a workspace in the âShared Foldersâ main folder. Permissions can be set for each user added to the workspace. \n Drag and drop functionality allows users to move collections, datasets, and/or files to the three main data areas, Trash can or other subfolders. \n String Search will search within the current folder or all project folders, i.e.,  My Data,  Team Data or Shared Spaces. \n Discussion boards Beta  can be created within a workspace to highlight and annotate data within that workspace, and can be viewed by all of that workspaceâs members. \n As part of the data migration, users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections. Collections now belong to projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n 3D Modeling Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer list is now record-focused. \n Badges to identify molecules, proteins and other components of datasets have been added to the 3D Viewer list. \n Tools for protein editing, including protonation state modification, capping terminal residues, and residue mutation have been added. \n When mutating protein residues, multiple residues can be selected and users can walk through applying a mutation to each residue in the selected set. \n Most of the small molecule editing tools can now be applied to proteins as well. \n The 3D molecule editor now contains the same set of molecular fragment templates as the 2D sketcher. \n An edited protein can be saved as a new dataset. \n A new receptor in OEDesignUnit (DU) display has been added. \n OEDesignUnit components can be edited and saved in place. \n Receptor ligands can be edited but not in place. Users need to make a copy of the ligand before editing.  Note : Receptor proteins cannot be edited. \n More options to save edited small molecules are now available. \n Users can edit datasets they donât own in place but need to save them to new datasets. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\n Project   Data  page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to the small molecule editing tools. \n Depiction tooltips in the list appear more reliably. \n \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to Data Handling. Users can now set the visibility for each column for each component of the user interface from the Data Handling dialog. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\nProject Data page. \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Spreadsheet fields now render correctly when users scroll to the right side of the spreadsheet. \n Layout issues when using multiple plots in trellis mode have been fixed. \n Molecules can now be sent to a Floe that takes a molecule fragment as input, for example, the Brood Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Selecting conformer points in the Scatter plot no longer fails intermittently. \n Saved color settings now persist. \n \n \n \n \n \n Floe User Interface Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n Support for a Job output folder path has been added to the Job Form. The default folder for Job output is âMy Dataâ, however, users can select\na different folder or create a new one. \n Job Cost alert and termination thresholds can now be set on the Job Form. The default values are inherited from the âMy Job Cost Limitsâ set\non the usersâ Profile page. Job Cost thresholds for any given job can be disabled by clearing the current value or setting the value to zero.\nThe values of these thresholds can be adjusted on the Job Status page after a job has been launched. \n Cubes in a running job are now colored specially when they are being throttled. More details are available in the Floe help. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n A bug has been fixed that caused Job parameters for jobs launched from the Orion command line interface (OCLI) from being displayed on the Job Status page. \n A bug that prevented the Job Form from opening for certain Floes has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n An issue that sometimes caused duplicate input or output parameters to appear in the Job Form has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Minor internal improvements have been made to  FastROCS ,  MaaS , and  MMDS . \n \n \n \n \n \n Admin Mode Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Options to customize Job Cost email alerts for Organization admins have been added. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

You can find links\nto them in this section and in relevant places elsewhere in this manual.  For a list of all tutorial videos,\nsee  Orion Video Tutorials . \n \n Data organization video Â¶ \n The features for organizing data have been revamped significantly.  For an introduction, try\nthis video:\n Data Organization in Orion . \n \n \n Discussion board videos Â¶ \n Discussion boards are a new user interface feature introduced in this version, accessed\nvia an icon on the  Project   Data  page:\n Introducing Discussion Boards \n We welcome your feedback on discussion boards after you have used them:\n Using Discussion Boards . \n For more about discussion boards, see  Discussion boards . \n \n \n 3D modeling videos Â¶ \n There are new badge and list features on the  3D   Modeling  page.\nHere is an introduction:  Badges and Lists in Orion . \n There are several more new videos about 3D modeling at  Orion Video Tutorials . \n \n \n \n Highlights Â¶ \n \n \n This release introduces a revamped  Project   Data  page which now uses a path- and folder-based file system for data organization. \n A desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders, or launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections as part of data migration. \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the  Home  page when users first login to Orion. \n Many enhancements have been made to  3D   Modeling  page, including several new tools for protein editing. \n Molecules, proteins, and other components of a dataset can now be identified using badges. \n Tooltips in the  3D   Viewer  have been enhanced. \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n A new discussion board Beta  feature is now available. \n This release introduces Orion stack protection through rate-limiting. \n Job cost email alerts can now be created. \n A dedicated  Organization   Data  project has been added. The data in this project are available to all Organization users and are prepopulated with\nOpenEye Data such as Collections used for virtual screening. \n New Floes have been added to  Floe  packages including: \n \n \n Non-Equilibrium Switching (NES) Floes in the MD Floe package. \n Cluster Poses, FastROCS,  and FreeForm Pose Floes in the Large-Scale-Floes package. \n Large-Scale Reaction Enumeration Floes in the Generative Design Floe package. \n \n \n \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types. \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Orion stack protection through rate-limiting has been implemented. \n Job cost email alerts are now available. Organization admins can set Job cost limits alerts for the entire organization on the Profile page. In addition, users can set\nJob cost limits alerts and Job termination thresholds for their own jobs on the Profile page. Job cost alerts can also be set prior to running a job on the Job Form.\nThese cost thresholds can be updated while a Job is running on the Job Status page. \n This release introduces a new Discussion Board Beta . Saved discussions may contain notes, images, or snapshot links of the 3D Modeling or Analyze pages.\nDiscussions are accessible to all team members. \n Substructure searching is now accessible from the databar filters. This functionality was previously available only on the Analyze page. \n Cubes which are being throttled now show up with special coloring. \n More information has been added to Job Debugging Data. \n A new instance-draining state has been added, which allows jobs to continue running but prevents new jobs from using the instance. \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types.\nFor new data being written to a dataset, it will be cast/coerced/promoted to the type of the existing dataset field. This matches what drconvert does.\nWhen writing records, if an incompatible type of data for a given field name is seen, the writer generates a new alternate field and stores the data in\nan alternate field rather than failing the writing process. \n \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the Home page when users first login to Orion. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A dedicated Organization Data project has been added. Data in this project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. In addition, the\nOrganization Data project is pre-populated with OpenEye-supplied data such as the Brood database, OpenEye-prepared third-party vendor collections for virtual screening,\ntutorial datasets, and other data that can be used as input to some of the included Orion Floes.  Note : The Organization Data project is only visible to Organization\nadmins in the list of projects in the Navbar and Home page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Organization admins now have control over the listing of projects on the Home page and Navbar on the Project Summary page. Organization admins can now toggle between\nâShow Allâ Organization projects and âShow Ownâ projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The Project Data page has been overhauled and now uses a folder-based file system for organizing your data, instead of a flat view. \n Within a project, data are organized into three main areas: \n \n \n My Data â your private data. No other users have access to this data. \n Team Data â data that are available to all project members. \n Shared Spaces â data that are available to select project members, i.e. shared data among the selected project members. \n \n \n \n New folders can be created from the Project Data page, when uploading data, and when launching a Floe from the Job Form. \n A dedicated Organization Data project is available to everyone in the Organization and is located above the Project Data folder hierarchy. Data in\nthis project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. \n The path to a desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders or when launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Folders and subfolders can be added to the  Favorite   Folders  space for quick and easy access. \n Data are now shared by creating a workspace in the âShared Foldersâ main folder. Permissions can be set for each user added to the workspace. \n Drag and drop functionality allows users to move collections, datasets, and/or files to the three main data areas, Trash can or other subfolders. \n String Search will search within the current folder or all project folders, i.e.,  My Data,  Team Data or Shared Spaces. \n Discussion boards Beta  can be created within a workspace to highlight and annotate data within that workspace, and can be viewed by all of that workspaceâs members. \n As part of the data migration, users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections. Collections now belong to projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n 3D Modeling Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer list is now record-focused. \n Badges to identify molecules, proteins and other components of datasets have been added to the 3D Viewer list. \n Tools for protein editing, including protonation state modification, capping terminal residues, and residue mutation have been added. \n When mutating protein residues, multiple residues can be selected and users can walk through applying a mutation to each residue in the selected set. \n Most of the small molecule editing tools can now be applied to proteins as well. \n The 3D molecule editor now contains the same set of molecular fragment templates as the 2D sketcher. \n An edited protein can be saved as a new dataset. \n A new receptor in OEDesignUnit (DU) display has been added. \n OEDesignUnit components can be edited and saved in place. \n Receptor ligands can be edited but not in place. Users need to make a copy of the ligand before editing.  Note : Receptor proteins cannot be edited. \n More options to save edited small molecules are now available. \n Users can edit datasets they donât own in place but need to save them to new datasets. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\n Project   Data  page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to the small molecule editing tools. \n Depiction tooltips in the list appear more reliably. \n \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to Data Handling. Users can now set the visibility for each column for each component of the user interface from the Data Handling dialog. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\nProject Data page. \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Spreadsheet fields now render correctly when users scroll to the right side of the spreadsheet. \n Layout issues when using multiple plots in trellis mode have been fixed. \n Molecules can now be sent to a Floe that takes a molecule fragment as input, for example, the Brood Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Selecting conformer points in the Scatter plot no longer fails intermittently. \n Saved color settings now persist. \n \n \n \n \n \n Floe User Interface Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n Support for a Job output folder path has been added to the Job Form. The default folder for Job output is âMy Dataâ, however, users can select\na different folder or create a new one. \n Job Cost alert and termination thresholds can now be set on the Job Form. The default values are inherited from the âMy Job Cost Limitsâ set\non the usersâ Profile page. Job Cost thresholds for any given job can be disabled by clearing the current value or setting the value to zero.\nThe values of these thresholds can be adjusted on the Job Status page after a job has been launched. \n Cubes in a running job are now colored specially when they are being throttled. More details are available in the Floe help. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n A bug has been fixed that caused Job parameters for jobs launched from the Orion command line interface (OCLI) from being displayed on the Job Status page. \n A bug that prevented the Job Form from opening for certain Floes has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n An issue that sometimes caused duplicate input or output parameters to appear in the Job Form has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Minor internal improvements have been made to  FastROCS ,  MaaS , and  MMDS . \n \n \n \n \n \n Admin Mode Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Options to customize Job Cost email alerts for Organization admins have been added. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

The number of instances increase \n (Up Arrow) or decrease (Down Arrow) dynamically to meet changing conditions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Details \n Shows the state of the ASG  and whether it is Active or Deactivated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Healthy : Number of instances currently available to do process work. \n \n Desired Instances : Number of instances the scheduler would like to have as healthy. \n \n Min. Size : Minimum size of the group (the default is 0). \n \n Max. Size : Maximum size of the group (a useful value to limit spend in Orion). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Usage \n Amount of resources currently provided by the ASG. \n \n Cost/Hour \n Hourly instance cost. If spot, it will update regularly. \n \n Pool \n Scheduler feature used to segregate tasks into separate scaling groups. \n \n Edit \n \n Allows an Orion Stack admin to manage an ASG. Available options \n are Min Size, Max Size, Min Reserve, Affinity, and State. \n \n \n \n \n \n As tasks are submitted to  Orion , the scheduler decides where to place the work based on the hardware\nand spot requirements of the cubes, as well as other factors (such as pool or affinity). As the workload grows, more\ninstances are launched. This is first seen by an increased desired instances count; soon thereafter, the healthy\ninstances should match this. Desired and healthy instances are not allowed to exceed the maximum size. \n Once work is complete and  Orion  starts to scale down, users then see the desired count drop far more quickly than the healthy count. This is for\ntwo reasons: (1) those instances are likely still working on their current task, and (2)  Orion  does not terminate instances\nimmediately after they complete work as startup time is real (several minutes depending on instance type and\npricing model), so they remain as hot instances for new work. \n If the desired count is higher than the healthy count for a long period,\nthere is probably limited spot availability, or no availability. \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

You can find links\nto them in this section and in relevant places elsewhere in this manual.  For a list of all tutorial videos,\nsee  Orion Video Tutorials . \n \n Data organization video Â¶ \n The features for organizing data have been revamped significantly.  For an introduction, try\nthis video:\n Data Organization in Orion . \n \n \n Discussion board videos Â¶ \n Discussion boards are a new user interface feature introduced in this version, accessed\nvia an icon on the  Project   Data  page:\n Introducing Discussion Boards \n We welcome your feedback on discussion boards after you have used them:\n Using Discussion Boards . \n For more about discussion boards, see  Discussion boards . \n \n \n 3D modeling videos Â¶ \n There are new badge and list features on the  3D   Modeling  page.\nHere is an introduction:  Badges and Lists in Orion . \n There are several more new videos about 3D modeling at  Orion Video Tutorials . \n \n \n \n Highlights Â¶ \n \n \n This release introduces a revamped  Project   Data  page which now uses a path- and folder-based file system for data organization. \n A desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders, or launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections as part of data migration. \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the  Home  page when users first login to Orion. \n Many enhancements have been made to  3D   Modeling  page, including several new tools for protein editing. \n Molecules, proteins, and other components of a dataset can now be identified using badges. \n Tooltips in the  3D   Viewer  have been enhanced. \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n A new discussion board Beta  feature is now available. \n This release introduces Orion stack protection through rate-limiting. \n Job cost email alerts can now be created. \n A dedicated  Organization   Data  project has been added. The data in this project are available to all Organization users and are prepopulated with\nOpenEye Data such as Collections used for virtual screening. \n New Floes have been added to  Floe  packages including: \n \n \n Non-Equilibrium Switching (NES) Floes in the MD Floe package. \n Cluster Poses, FastROCS,  and FreeForm Pose Floes in the Large-Scale-Floes package. \n Large-Scale Reaction Enumeration Floes in the Generative Design Floe package. \n \n \n \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types. \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Orion stack protection through rate-limiting has been implemented. \n Job cost email alerts are now available. Organization admins can set Job cost limits alerts for the entire organization on the Profile page. In addition, users can set\nJob cost limits alerts and Job termination thresholds for their own jobs on the Profile page. Job cost alerts can also be set prior to running a job on the Job Form.\nThese cost thresholds can be updated while a Job is running on the Job Status page. \n This release introduces a new Discussion Board Beta . Saved discussions may contain notes, images, or snapshot links of the 3D Modeling or Analyze pages.\nDiscussions are accessible to all team members. \n Substructure searching is now accessible from the databar filters. This functionality was previously available only on the Analyze page. \n Cubes which are being throttled now show up with special coloring. \n More information has been added to Job Debugging Data. \n A new instance-draining state has been added, which allows jobs to continue running but prevents new jobs from using the instance. \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types.\nFor new data being written to a dataset, it will be cast/coerced/promoted to the type of the existing dataset field. This matches what drconvert does.\nWhen writing records, if an incompatible type of data for a given field name is seen, the writer generates a new alternate field and stores the data in\nan alternate field rather than failing the writing process. \n \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the Home page when users first login to Orion. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A dedicated Organization Data project has been added. Data in this project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. In addition, the\nOrganization Data project is pre-populated with OpenEye-supplied data such as the Brood database, OpenEye-prepared third-party vendor collections for virtual screening,\ntutorial datasets, and other data that can be used as input to some of the included Orion Floes.  Note : The Organization Data project is only visible to Organization\nadmins in the list of projects in the Navbar and Home page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Organization admins now have control over the listing of projects on the Home page and Navbar on the Project Summary page. Organization admins can now toggle between\nâShow Allâ Organization projects and âShow Ownâ projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The Project Data page has been overhauled and now uses a folder-based file system for organizing your data, instead of a flat view. \n Within a project, data are organized into three main areas: \n \n \n My Data â your private data. No other users have access to this data. \n Team Data â data that are available to all project members. \n Shared Spaces â data that are available to select project members, i.e. shared data among the selected project members. \n \n \n \n New folders can be created from the Project Data page, when uploading data, and when launching a Floe from the Job Form. \n A dedicated Organization Data project is available to everyone in the Organization and is located above the Project Data folder hierarchy. Data in\nthis project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. \n The path to a desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders or when launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Folders and subfolders can be added to the  Favorite   Folders  space for quick and easy access. \n Data are now shared by creating a workspace in the âShared Foldersâ main folder. Permissions can be set for each user added to the workspace. \n Drag and drop functionality allows users to move collections, datasets, and/or files to the three main data areas, Trash can or other subfolders. \n String Search will search within the current folder or all project folders, i.e.,  My Data,  Team Data or Shared Spaces. \n Discussion boards Beta  can be created within a workspace to highlight and annotate data within that workspace, and can be viewed by all of that workspaceâs members. \n As part of the data migration, users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections. Collections now belong to projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n 3D Modeling Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer list is now record-focused. \n Badges to identify molecules, proteins and other components of datasets have been added to the 3D Viewer list. \n Tools for protein editing, including protonation state modification, capping terminal residues, and residue mutation have been added. \n When mutating protein residues, multiple residues can be selected and users can walk through applying a mutation to each residue in the selected set. \n Most of the small molecule editing tools can now be applied to proteins as well. \n The 3D molecule editor now contains the same set of molecular fragment templates as the 2D sketcher. \n An edited protein can be saved as a new dataset. \n A new receptor in OEDesignUnit (DU) display has been added. \n OEDesignUnit components can be edited and saved in place. \n Receptor ligands can be edited but not in place. Users need to make a copy of the ligand before editing.  Note : Receptor proteins cannot be edited. \n More options to save edited small molecules are now available. \n Users can edit datasets they donât own in place but need to save them to new datasets. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\n Project   Data  page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to the small molecule editing tools. \n Depiction tooltips in the list appear more reliably. \n \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to Data Handling. Users can now set the visibility for each column for each component of the user interface from the Data Handling dialog. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\nProject Data page. \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Spreadsheet fields now render correctly when users scroll to the right side of the spreadsheet. \n Layout issues when using multiple plots in trellis mode have been fixed. \n Molecules can now be sent to a Floe that takes a molecule fragment as input, for example, the Brood Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Selecting conformer points in the Scatter plot no longer fails intermittently. \n Saved color settings now persist. \n \n \n \n \n \n Floe User Interface Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n Support for a Job output folder path has been added to the Job Form. The default folder for Job output is âMy Dataâ, however, users can select\na different folder or create a new one. \n Job Cost alert and termination thresholds can now be set on the Job Form. The default values are inherited from the âMy Job Cost Limitsâ set\non the usersâ Profile page. Job Cost thresholds for any given job can be disabled by clearing the current value or setting the value to zero.\nThe values of these thresholds can be adjusted on the Job Status page after a job has been launched. \n Cubes in a running job are now colored specially when they are being throttled. More details are available in the Floe help. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n A bug has been fixed that caused Job parameters for jobs launched from the Orion command line interface (OCLI) from being displayed on the Job Status page. \n A bug that prevented the Job Form from opening for certain Floes has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n An issue that sometimes caused duplicate input or output parameters to appear in the Job Form has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Minor internal improvements have been made to  FastROCS ,  MaaS , and  MMDS . \n \n \n \n \n \n Admin Mode Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Options to customize Job Cost email alerts for Organization admins have been added. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Floes are constructed of cubes, which are small programming elements. Floes and cubes\nare uploaded and incorporated into  Orion  as tar packages or docker images. (See  the development instructions\nin the Programming Guide for more information about packaging .) When loaded, floes can be\nshared like any other dataset. Uploaded\nfloes are found in and run from the  Floes  tab and the  Editor  tab.\nIn the  Floes  tab, they can also be assigned to other feature domains. \n \n When a floe is launched, its progress can be\nfollowed graphically and in real time.  A floe in progress is shown in the  Jobs  tab, with different\ncolors indicating the status of the cubes. \n \n \n Figure 1. A Floe in Progress Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n A cost analysis is available before, during, and after each\nfloe. After each floe completes, a notification is posted that can be viewed by clicking the  Notifications  icon ( ).\n(When you launch a floe, or in your profile, you can also ask to receive an email when a job completes.)   The job\nmay also produce output datasets or an\nHTML report file. A log file of the floe job is also presented. \n Job cost alerts can be set globally for all floe runs in the Profile section.\nUsers can modify job cost thresholds in the Job Form before launching a floe and during the run. \n \n Specify a Path when Launching a Floe Run Â¶ \n A path or location can be specified in the job\nsubmission form. When launching a floe run, you will see an\n Output   path  property field. The default path will be\n Project   Name/My   Data . You can type in a new directory name,\nwhich will be created when the output is written. To go up a directory, click on\nthe up arrow or use the backspace key to move up one\ndirectory. Finally, select the path you want. \n \n \n Find a Floe in Orion Â¶ \n You can find a particular floe, out of the many available, using the  Floe  page with these techniques: \n \n Navigate to the floe using the categories in the left-hand pane. \n \n The  Created   in   Floe   Editor  category shows floes that do not have an associated package and thus were likely\ncreated in the  Editor .   See the Programming Guide for more information about the Floe\nEditor . \n The  Packages  category groups floes according to the packages in which they are built.  You may be familiar\nwith this nomenclature from past releases.  For example, selecting the package  OpenEye  Biomodeler Floes in the\ndrop-down displays the floes associated with that package. \n The  Product-based  category corresponds to the names of  OpenEye  products, such as  BROOD .  This\ncategory is one deep: if you select  BROOD , you will get the list of floes associated with that product, displayed\nin the right-hand pane. \n The  Role-based ,  Solution-based , and  Task-based  categories are deeper, meaning you might go through\none or more subcategories to get to a specific list of floes. \n \n \n Search for the floe using the search bar labeled âSearch Floes and Categoriesâ in the right-hand pane.  This search looks for\nthe search term among the category terms and in the brief description of the floe.  The brief appears in a list of\nfloes; it is not the longer description that appears when you display an individual floe.\nThe search should give you a concise list of relevant floes. \n \n \n \n Figure 2.

Collections, datasets, and raw data files are\naccessible here.  The data organization system implements familiar concepts of paths and folders\nto organize and access data in  Orion . \n The Programming Guide has additional technical details about data handling in Orion . \n \n Organizing and sharing data in folders Â¶ \n Users can organize the data according to the way they would like\nto share data among team members in a project. In addition, there are controlled data sharing\ncapabilities among members in the project. To achieve these objectives, the following main folders\nare available to users. \n \n My Data The data in this location are private and only\naccessible by the user. However, these data still can be shared by moving the data to a Shared\nSpace workspace. Data are put in My Data unless you specify otherwise in your upload. \n Only you can see the data until you share it to the Team or Shared folders. \n \n Team Data The data in this location are available to all project members. \n \n Shared Spaces The data in this location are available to the project members selected by the user. \n \n \n \n Orion provides automatic intraspection of files: hovering gives a depiction of the\nfirst structure if the file contains small molecules, or a protein schematic if amino acids\nare present. Selecting one or more datasets creates an active dataset. Active datasets are\ncarried forward to any feature domain (for example, moving to the Analyze page automatically\npopulates the spreadsheet). The  Project   Data  page also shows which filters are currently\napplied to the active data. \n \n Project Data Page Layout Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Add Data  button \n Allows users to add data by uploading files,  sketching , or importing a biomolecule. \n \n Search \n Allows users to search for collections, datasets, or files by name or tag. \n \n Show  drop-down \n Allows users to show any assortment of collections, datasets, and files. \n \n Sort by  drop-down \n Allows users sort by one of several options. \n \n Datasets Table \n Lists project datasets, sorted as specified by the  Sort   by:  drop-down. \n \n Trash Can \n Repository for deleted datasets. To restore the dataset, click on the Trash Can, select the dataset, and drag it to the\nappropriate folder. \n \n \n \n \n Tile View Â¶ \n Another form of intraspection is available for small molecule files: the tile view. Activate the tile view by\nclicking the   icon to the left of a dataset name.\nOn completion of the browsing of structures, click  Cancel , and you will be returned to the originating page. \n \n The tile view displays a panel list of structures in 2D or 3D, with associated\nproperties. It can be configured to display single structures, a side-by-side view, a grid compare view, or a grid view.\nEntries can be sorted by properties selected from all those available within the dataset.\nThe tile view is designed for fast traversal; selected structures can form the basis of a selected set on leaving\nthe page. \n \n \n What actions do I need to take if I had an account on a pre-2021 version of Orion? Â¶ \n If you have a pre-2021  Orion  account, you\nwill need to take some action on the shared data from previous  Orion  versions. \n \n Decide how to organize the data. \n Move all previously shared items into the appropriate folders. \n Assign collections to a project. \n \n \n AWS Representation \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can. Anything in the\nTrash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. \n In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ\noption. Please consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n \n Searching for data Â¶ \n You can search for datasets by entering a tag or resource name in the search\nbar. Select the main folder or space you would like to search. Next, enter the tag\nor resource name and click on that name. Then, the results will be shown at the bottom\nof the page. In addition, you will be able to see the path where this data can be\nfound. \n \n \n Uploading data Â¶ \n You can specify a path when uploading a file into  Orion . To specify a path,\nselect the folder or subfolders as applicable. Alternatively, you can go up a\ndirectory by clicking on the up arrow or using the backspace key.\nAlso, you can create a new subfolder by entering the name and then\nclicking on  Create   a   new   folder . \n \n CXSMILES Data Â¶ \n Data can be uploaded in CXSMILES format. (Data/My Data/+Add Data/Uploadâ¦.) \n \n \n \n Downloading and Exporting Data Â¶ \n You can download data, and it will be converted to a canonical format if necessary. \n \n Select dataset > More Actions > Export. \n In the Export pop-up, choose your preferred file format, then click Export. \n In the notification panel, you can check the status of your exports. \n After download, optionally move or delete the exported file from My Data Exports. \n \n \n \n Deleting data Â¶ \n To delete data, first select the data you want to delete\nby clicking on the square box on the left side to the folder or subfolder name.\nNext, click the   icon on the far right or in the top menu.\nMultiple data can be selected and deleted at once. Then, these data will be\nmoved to the  Trash  space. The items in the trash will be automatically deleted after\n30 days. \n \n \n Preserving Data of a Removed User Â¶ \n Customers can open a support request to remove a user from an organization, which\ntransfers ownership of that userâs data to project owners or an organization administrator. \n \n \n Subfolders Â¶ \n To create a new subfolder, first select the place\n( My   Data ,  Team   Data  or  Shared   Spaces ) where you want to create a new subfolder.\nThen, click on the   icon next to the path (example:\nMy Data). In the pop-up window, enter the\nfolder name and click  OK . A new subfolder will be created\nwith the specified name in the selected path. \n You can create a new folder or subfolder in the same window you use to\nupload data or when starting a floe run. To do this,\nselect the path and then enter the name of the\nsubfolder you want to create. A green bar\nwill appear with  Create   a   new   folder  next to the\nsubfolder name you just entered. Click on  Create   a \n new   folder . A new folder or subfolder will show up\non the path specified. \n \n Favorite subfolders Â¶ \n To quickly access a subfolder, you can mark it as a favorite by clicking\non the  star  next to the folder, and it will be added to the  Favorite   Folders  area in the left side column. \n \n \n Deleting subfolders Â¶ \n To delete a subfolder, select the subfolder you want to\ndelete and click on the   icon. The subfolder and all the contents in this\nsubfolder will be moved to the Trash space. The items in the trash will be automatically\ndeleted after 30 days. \n \n \n Moving a subfolder Â¶ \n A subfolder can be moved to another path or location. To do this, select the folder you\nwould like to move, and click either the bi-directional line icon on top or the ellipsis\nicon, and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path and click the  Move  button.\nThe subfolder (and its contents) will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n \n Video tutorial about project data Â¶ \n For more information on the use of the project data\nfacilities,  see the tutorial video . \n \n Note \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can.\nAnything in the Trash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ option.\nPlease consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n Moving data between projects Â¶ \n Data (datasets, files and collections) can be moved between projects, folders or subfolders.\nTo do this, select the data you would like to move and click the bi-directional line icon or\nthe ellipsis ( ... ) icon and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path, and click\nthe  Move  button. The selected data will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n Collection Metadata Â¶ \n Some collections feature an information icon ( ) that displays pregenerated metadata about the collection. The\ninformation may be helpful in working with collections, because you can see the metadata immediately, without having\nto run a floe. \n \n \n \n \n \n Discussion boards Â¶ \n You often need not only to share data with team members but also to discuss the results\nwith them. \n Discussion boards are accessed by the âchatâ icon ( ) on the  Project   Data  page. If you select the\nicon, you get a display on the right side of the screen that will be familiar from\nother chat experiences you have used. \n You can share links and images along with text comments, and discussions are preserved\nso you can revisit them.  The discussion board  autosaves usersâ edits. \n For an introduction, see this training video: Introducing Discussion Boards \n You can see further information in this training video: Using Discussion Boards . \n \n \n Shared spaces Â¶ \n To share data, use the  Shared   Spaces  main folder (or space). \n You can start by creating a workspace in  Shared   Spaces . Click on the  +  icon\nnext to the path. A pop-up window named  Workspace   name  will appear. Enter the\nname of the workspace you want to create and click  OK . \n A new subfolder with the\nspecified name will show in the Shared Spaces. If you click on this workspace,\nthen you will have the option to add members with whom you want to share the data. \n Click on the   icon and then click on  Edit   Users . Enter the name of the\nuser/project member you want to add. In this window, you will have the option\nto set the permissions (write, delete) you want for that user to have.  All the\ndata in this workspace will be shared with the selected users/project members. \n Alternatively, if you would like all project members to have access to the data,\nsave the data in the  Team   Data  space. \n The items ( workspaces ) in  Shared   Spaces  resemble folders, but they are actually file systems in their own right.  The user interface\nenforces the differences between workspaces and folders. \n \n Note \n With folders, access to data by others is determined by the folder you choose to use.  For example, things in the  Team   Data  folder\nare accessible to all members of the project team. For the workspaces within  Shared   Spaces , you can define a subset of users who have access to the workspace\nand its data.  You can pick the users by use of the   icon. \n \n \n Move, Drag-and-Drop The user interface does not show these actions for workspaces in the list of workspaces because they cannot be performed. \n \n Create and Rename and Delete You can perform these actions on workspaces. \n \n Inside a workspace Folders created within a workspace behave as other folders do. \n \n \n \n \n Workspace with contents Â¶ \n \n \n \n List of workspaces Â¶ \n \n \n \n Organization Data Page Â¶ \n \n \n Data available to an organization Â¶ \n \n The  Organization   Data  space allows for\nadmin users to share datasets and collections with the entire organization. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

All panes can be moved, removed, resized, or duplicated.\nThere are two views: a spreadsheet view and a 3D analysis view. \n The graphing feature can represent data with five different variables, some categorical and some continuous, via the choice of\npoint shapes, size, color, and their x and y values. Scatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and violin plots are\navailable, where appropriate, for the selected data type(s). Multiple graphs can be created. Points can be selected by lasso\nor by point-and-click. Depictions of structures can be accessed for any selected points. The graph can be moved, panned,\nor reset. Scales can be changed between linear to log forms. Regression lines (with error bars) can be added. Box plots\ncontain quartile ranges and other annotations. \n \n \n Figure 1.  When a point in the plot is selected, the spreadsheet navigates to the row representing that point. You can also select a row in the spreadsheet\nand see the corresponding point identified in the plot. Â¶ \n \n \n Spreadsheet Â¶ \n The spreadsheet allows typical actions: column sorting, pinning, reordering or deleting, and\nindication of selected rows.\nPop-up views of structures are also available. The spreadsheet data can be manipulated by\na data-handling panel that allows\ncolumns to be turned on or off. It also allows for a style to be chosen for treating imprecise\ndata (for example, ranges, inequalities, multiple values). \n JSON  data fields are viewable in the spreadsheet. \n Categorical string fields can  be filtered using a âfree textâ setting. This allows\ncreation of filters that can match multiple distinct categorical values that contain a\nprovided string. \n \n \n Figure 2.  Spreadsheet cells can be copied to the system clipboard.

It also\nshows how to use an assortment of user interface features, such as examination of binding sites. \n DNA gyrase (GyrB) and topoisomerase IV (Topo IV) are clinically validated targets for the treatment of\nresistant bacterial infections. In a study carried out at a big Pharma, pyrrolamides were shown to exhibit\nantibacterial activity by competing with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in DNA gyrase and Topo IV. \n In this simulation, your role as the only modeler on the pyrrolamides optimization project\nis to guide the medicinal chemists\nin their design decisions; they want suggestions on what to synthesize next. Your ultimate goal is to help\nthem synthesize the depicted compound. \n \n \n Figure 1: Target Compound Â¶ \n \n You will explore  docking  in this retrospective study. In the drug discovery process, structure-based methods such\nas dockingâthe lock-and-key concept where the protein is the lock and the ligand is the keyâuse the structure of\na target protein to discover hits and optimize leads. In hit discovery or virtual screening, no molecules are\nknown that are active\nagainst the target protein. Docking is used to identify possible active molecules in a large molecule database,\nby examining their shapes and chemical complementarity to the active site. \n Datasets \n \n \n Initial ligands: pyrrolamides_3D.sdf â download the dataset below. \n Receptor: 3TTZ_A_receptor â download the receptor below. \n Conformer database â generate from pyrrolamides_3D dataset (see below). \n \n \n \n Download dataset of initial ligands \n pyrrolamides_3D.sdf \n \n \n Download receptor \n 3TTZ_A__receptor.oeb \n \n After completing this task, you will be able to: \n \n \n Upload datasets into  Orion \n Run an  Omega  floe \n Retrieve a receptor from a database \n Identify the binding pocket \n Perceive protein-ligand interactions \n Run a docking floe \n Analyze docking results in the  Analyze  page \n Perform a substructure search \n Add property data to a spreadsheet \n Sort the data in a spreadsheet \n Export data \n \n \n \n Navigate to the  Orion  Home page and create a project called âDocking Demo.â \n \n \n \n Figure 2.  By Default, Orion Switches to the New Project Automatically Â¶ \n \n \n Navigate to the  Data  (Project Data) page and upload the ligand file pyrrolamides_3D.sdf. \n \n \n \n Figure 3: Adding Data Â¶ \n \n \n \n Figure 4: Ready to Upload a File of Data Â¶ \n \n A dialog pops up showing that the upload is in progress, then a conversion floe, File to Dataset Import, runs quickly, producing a\ndataset from the uploaded file. \n You can see the recent notifications by clicking the  Notifications  icon ( ). \n \n \n Figure 5: Notification List Â¶ \n \n The end result is shown here. \n \n \n Figure 6: Requesting Job Details Â¶ \n \n The icon next to the job details on the upper right ( ) shows the job that produced the dataset.  A job is\nan instance of a workflow, or floe, in this case the format conversion floe File to Dataset Import. \n \n \n Figure 7: A Successfully Completed Job Â¶ \n \n Here, a File to Record Converter cube uploaded and converted the ligand file and then it fed its output to the Dataset Writer\ncube. \n \n Switch to the  Floe  (Workfloe) page, select the  OMEGA   -   3D   Conformer   Ensemble   Generation  Floe and generate ligand conformers. \n \n \n \n Figure 8: Listing Floes That Use Omega Â¶ \n \n \n \n Figure 9: Launching a Specific Omega Floe Â¶ \n \n Click on the  Choose   input...  button, and the screen will navigate to your  My   Data  folder in the project data.\nSelect the  pyrrolamides_3D  file as input to the OMEGA - 3D Conformer Ensemble Generation floe. \n \n \n Figure 10: Selecting an Input Dataset Â¶ \n \n Click on the name  pyrrolamides_3D  to select that file, and then click the   icon to provide it as input\nto the floe.  You can leave the other parameters with their default values and click the   icon. \n \n The floe runs for only a few minutes, after which there is a new\ndatasetâthe set of conformersâin your data folder. \n \n \n \n Figure 11: Job Details for an Omega Floe Â¶ \n \n \n \n Figure 12: Output of an Omega Floe Â¶ \n \n 5.

This is sometimes\nequivalent to the biological unit (BU), but often requires manipulation to create a correct BU. \n \n AUC Â¶ The area under the curve (AUC) of  ROC curve  is an aggregate measure of\nperformance across all possible classification thresholds.\nThe AUC value varies between  \\([0.0 - 1.0]\\) .\nThe  model with perfect predictions has an AUC of 1.0 while a model that always gets\nthe predictions wrong has a AUC value of 0.0.\nThe value 0.5 represents random prediction.\nThe AUC number can be interpreted as the probability that the model ranks a random\npositive example more highly than a random negative example. See also\n Area under the curve \nin Wikipedia and  ROC curve . \n \n B-factor Â¶ B-factor (temperature factor) describes the displacement of the atomic\npositions from an average value.\nThe more flexible an atom is the larger the displacement\nfrom the mean position will be (mean-squares displacement).\nThe values of the B-factors are normally between 15 to 30 (sq. ÃngstrÃ¶ms),\nbut can be much higher for more flexible regions.\nB-factors can indicate the mobility of atoms and they can also\nindicate where there are errors in model building. \n \n biological unit Â¶ In short, the biological unit (BU) is an object that contains the biologically relevant parts of an\nASU, which have not been split into various molecular components and are not yet prepped for modeling. For a more\ndetailed explanation of BUs, refer to  Introduction to Biological Assemblies and the PDB Archive  hosted at the RCSB. \n \n bug-fix release Â¶ Toolkit and Applications bug-fix  releases happen between features releases, if necessary.\nThese releases provide crucial bug fixes but no new features or platform\nupdates. \n \n canonical SMILES Â¶ In OpenEye documentation, the term canonical SMILES is used for a unique SMILES string\nthat encodes the connection table of a molecule, but no chiral or\nisotopic information.\nConsequently, two stereoisomers always share the same canonical SMILES, since\ntheir stereo information are ignored during the canonicalization process.\nFor generating a canonical SMILES, use the\n OECreateCanSmiString  function. OpenEyeâs canonical\nSMILES term corresponds to  Daylight âs   unique  SMILES definition. \n \n canonical isomeric SMILES Â¶ In OpenEye documentation, the name  canonical isomeric SMILES  is used for a unique SMILES\nstring that also encodes isotopic and stereo information.\nDue to the unambiguity of canonical isomeric SMILES, they can be used as a\nuniversal identifier for a specific chemical structure.\nFor generating a canonical isomeric SMILES, use the\n OECreateIsoSmiString  or the  preferred  high-level\n OEMolToSmiles  function. OpenEyeâs canonical isomeric SMILES terminology corresponds to  Daylight âs\n absolute  SMILES definition. \n \n chiral atom Â¶ In OpenEye terminology, an atom is considered chiral if it is connected to four different\nsubstituent groups, that is, its mirror image is not superimposable.In  OEChem TK , an easily invertible nitrogen, that is,  a nonplanar nitrogen with one attached\nhydrogen, is not considered to be chiral. This is due to the fact that trivalent\nnitrogen compound undergo rapid inversion that interconvert enantiomers. See also the\n stereo atom  definition, the SetChiral and IsChiral methods of\n OEAtomBase , and the\n Atom Chirality  section. \n \n chiral bond Â¶ In  OEChem TK , a double bond is considered chiral if the cis and\ntrans forms of this bond represent two distinct isomers.\nA chiral bond can be either a chain bond or a ring bond that does\nnot belong to any ring smaller than 8-membered. See also the\n stereo atom  definition, the SetChiral and IsChiral methods of\n OEAtomBase , and the\n Atom Chirality  section. \n \n CIP Â¶ The CIP (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog) system is rule-based method used in\norganic chemistry to name the stereoisomers of a molecule.\nThe CIP system assigns an R or S descriptor to each stereocenter\nand an E or Z descriptor to each double bond so that the\nconfiguration of the entire molecule can be specified uniquely. \n \n conformer Â¶ conformers Â¶ Conformation isomers are commonly called conformers. Conformational isomers\nare stereoisomers that differ from one another by rotation around a single bond.\nConformational isomers can be converted from one to another by rotations about formally single bonds\nwithout making or breaking any covalent bonds. \n \n CPK Â¶ CPK (Corey,Pauling,Koltun) is a popular color convention for\ndistinguishing atoms of different chemical elements in molecular\nmodels. See also the  Appendix: Element coloring (CPK)  chapter and the\n OEAtomColorStyle  namespace. \n \n CSV Â¶ Comma-separated-values file format.  See also the CSV standard\nat  RFC 4180  and the\n CSV File Format  section. \n \n cube Â¶ cubes Â¶ Basic computational components used to construct a\nprogrammed workflow for execution in Orion.  Cubes communicate\nwith one another via messages and transmit data using defined input and output ports.\nCubes can be written\nin Python, from scratch, using OpenEye APIs. These APIs,\nas well as ready-made cubes for\ngeneral computation tasks, are provided as part of the\n Orion Platform package .\nReady-made cubes for scientific computations are available\nin the  OpenEye Snowball package . \n \n CUDA Â¶ GPU-enabled calculation.\nCUDA mode involves preloading all fingerprints into GPU memory prior to performing\nsimilarity calculations. While this represents the fastest way to perform similarity\nsearches once the fingerprints are loaded, searches are limited by GPU memory availability\nand will fall back to the  memory-mapped  CPU mode if the entire set of fingerprints\ncannot be preloaded into the GPU memory. \n \n CXSMILES Â¶ The Chemaxon Extended SMILES format which adds an additional (and optional) appendix to the SMILES string to encode\na wide variety of additional features that are not part of the SMILES representation proper.\nOnly the  canonical SMILES  portion of the CXSMILES information is canonically ordered.   There\nis no specification in the CXSMILES format that any ordering of information within the\nappendix is either expected or required. However, a deterministic sort order is applied to the appendix\nentries to facilitate the potential use of the CXSMILES string for structure duplicate checking\nwhich would consider different groupings of enhanced stereo groups as structure differentiating. See also\n CXSMILES documentation \n \n design unit Â¶ The design unit (DU) is an object that contains the extracted and prepared parts of a\nsingle  biological unit  (BU), ready for modeling. The parts include \n \n \n protein; \n ligand (not always: an\napo DU will not contain a ligand); \n site residues; \n packing residues (if any exist near the site); and \n excipients (if any exist near the site). \n \n \n One can interact with each part of the DU through APIs. The APIs are listed here  OEDesignUnit . \n \n dock Â¶ docking Â¶ Docking is a molecular modeling technique used to predict the optimal binding of a protein and a ligand. In the drug\ndiscovery process, structure-based methods such as dockingâthe lock-and-key concept where the protein is the lock\nand the ligand is the keyâuse the structure of a target protein to discover hits and optimize leads. Docking is used to identify\npossible active molecules in a large molecule database, by examining their shapes and chemical complementarity to\nthe active site. \n \n excipient Â¶ An  excipient is an inert substance that is formulated with an active drug to produce its\npharmaceutical dosage form. Excipients serve various roles, such as long-term stabilization, aiding the manufacturing\nprocess, and enhancing the therapeutic properties of the active drug in its dosage form, such as facilitating\ndrug absorption or enhancing solubility. \n \n FASTA Â¶ In bioinformatics and biochemistry, the FASTA format is a text-based format\nfor representing either nucleotide sequences or amino acid (protein) sequences,\nin which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes. \n \n feature release Â¶ Toolkit and Application feature releases take place in spring and fall.\nThese releases  provide support for new platforms and major and minor\ncode fixes as well as new features. \n \n fingerprint Â¶ Fingerprints do not use a predefined pattern dictionary; the encoded\nfragments are enumerated exhaustively.\nSince the number of possible patterns present in molecular structures\nis extremely large, it is impractical to assign a particular bit to\neach unique pattern, as in the case of the  structural key  method.\nInstead, each pattern is subjected to a hashing function that\nlogically ORs into the fingerprint.\nThe use of hashing inherently results in overlap of some structural\npatterns. \n \n floe Â¶ floes Â¶ Programmed workflows for execution by the web-based Orion workflow engine.\nMany\nready-made floes are developed and delivered by OpenEye, for\nexecution in the Orion environment.  For documentation of\nready-made floes and their use, see  the Orion Suites and Modules Guide .\nFloes can be developed using\nOrion programming interfaces (APIs) and can use either ready-made\ncubes delivered with OpenEye software or cubes of your own, developed\nwith the guidance of  the Orion Programming Guide . \n \n GRASP Â¶ GRASP is a molecular visualization and analysis program. It is\nparticularly useful for the display and manipulation of the\nsurfaces of molecules and their electrostatic properties.\n(online:fx.php/Software:GRASP) \n \n InChI Â¶ From  About the InChi Standard ,\nOriginally developed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the\nIUPAC International Chemical Identifier ( InChI ) is a character string generated by computer algorithm.\nIt is a tool to be used in software applications designed and developed by those who choose to use it.\nThe InChI algorithm turns chemical structures into machine-readable strings of information.\nInChIs are unique to the compound they describe and can encode absolute stereochemistry making\nchemicals and chemistry machine-readable and discoverable.\nThe  InChI  format and algorithm are non-proprietary and the software is open source, with ongoing\ndevelopment done by the community. A number of IUPAC working groups is currently creating standard\nfor those areas of chemistry that are not yet handled by the InChI algorithm. \n \n InChIKey Â¶ From  About the InChi Standard ,\nThe  InChIKey  has been designed so that Internet search engines can search and\nfind the links to a given  InChI .\nTo make the  InChIKey  the  InChI  string is subjected to a compression algorithm to create a fixed-length\nstring of upper-case characters. While the  InChI  to  InChIKey  hash compression is irreversible,\nthere are a number of  InChI  resolvers available to look up an  InChI  given an  InChIKey . \n \n in-memory Â¶ The in-memory mode involves preloading all fingerprints into memory\nand performing the search in the memory.\nWhile this represents the fastest way to perform similarity searches once\nthe fingerprints are loaded, searches are limited by memory availability. \n \n Iridium Â¶ Iridium [Warren-2012] is a metric used to estimate the model\nquality of a structure resulting from an X-ray crystallography experiment.\nFor more information about Iridium see  the discussion in the\nproduct documentation . \n \n JSON Â¶ Sort for JavaScript Object Notation, this is a language-independent data format that works with most common languages, such as Python,\nJava, and others in the C-family of languages. \n \n LINGO Â¶ LINGO is a very fast text-based molecular similarity search method.\nIt is based on fragmentation of  canonical isomeric SMILES  strings into overlapping\nsubstrings. See also  the discussion in the OEChem documentation . \n \n MACCS Â¶ MACCS is a 166 bit-long  structural key  descriptor in which each\nbit is associated with a specific structural pattern. \n \n marching cubes Â¶ (online:  Marching cubes ) \n \n memory-mapped Â¶ The memory-mapped mode has no load time penalty or memory limitation, but the\nsearch itself takes more time. \n \n module Â¶ modules Â¶ In Python,  modules  are files with the file type  .py .  A Python module can, and\nusually does, define multiple Python classes, methods, and other objects. For more information,\nsee the official Python documentation, such as  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html . \n \n MOL Â¶ A MOL type file uses a format originally defined by Molecular Design Limited\nthat encodes information about the atoms, bonds, connectivity, and coordinates\nof a molecule, in plain text. For more information, see\nthe  Wikipedia definition \n \n Monte Carlo Â¶ Monte Carlo simulations rely on repeated random sampling to model the probability of possible\noutcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted. Thus it is used to estimate model uncertainty.\nIn machine learning, Monte Carlo dropout refers to the process of randomly removing nodes from a neural network\nduring training to regularize learning and avoid overfitting. \n \n nonterminal atom Â¶ An atom is considered nonterminal if it is connected to two or more\nnonhydrogen atoms, that is, the method  GetHvyDegree()  of\n OEAtomBase  returns\na value greater than or equal to 2. \n \n OEB Â¶ This is a binary OpenEye format used as a compact way to represent molecules with\nmultiple  conformers . \n \n Orion back end Â¶ The Orion back end is the set of programs and services that make up the\nâserverâ part of the client/server Orion product. \n \n Orion Platform Â¶ The Orion Platform is the set of OpenEye-supported interfaces\nto the Orion back end.  Some interfaces are meant to be called by Python\nprograms and some are command-line programs. \n \n package Â¶ packages Â¶ In Python,  packages  are sets of Python scripts (programs) organized in a directories\nthat also includes an __init__.py script. The __init__.py script runs when the directory\nis opened; it may import  objects used by scripts in the package and perform\nother useful initial tasks for the packagesâ scripts.  Floe packages for\nuse in Orion are specific examples of Python packages. \n \n popcount Â¶ Popcount refers to the procedure of counting the number of 1s set in\na bit string.  It is available as a hardware instruction on many modern\nprocessors and can be used, as an alternative to software-based counting\nmethods, to speed up fingerprint operations. \n \n preliminary API Â¶ APIs that are still under development might be delivered and marked as\npreliminary. Providing early access means that the APIs can be improved\nbased on user feedback before committing to a final API design.\nPreliminary APIs will sometimes be made available for a limited set of\nplatforms and languages, usually Python and C++. \n \n project Â¶ In  Orion , a project is a  container for data  related to the pursuit of an objective.\nA project serves as a location to store data and allows for efficient sharing and collaboration.\nEach project has its own  Project Summary  page. \n \n raster image Â¶ Raster graphics represents of images as an array of pixels or\npoints of color. \n \n receptor Â¶ receptors Â¶ Receptors are a class of proteins that selectively bind to specific ligand molecules to change the behavior of a cell.\nThis binding may activate or inactivate a receptor. A receptor is an integral part of a Design Unit and contains\ninformation about the location and characteristics of the binding pocket. \n \n ROC curve Â¶ The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a two-dimensional graph\nin which the false positive rate is plotted on\nthe X-axis and the true positive rate is plotted on the Y-axis.\nThe ROC curves are useful to visualize and compare the performance of\nclassifier methods. See also\n Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)  in Wikipedia,\n An introduction to ROC analysis  by Tom Fawcett, and\nthe definition of  AUC . \n \n rotatable bond Â¶ In OpenEye documentation, a bond is considered rotatable only if it is a single nonring bond\nbetween two  nonterminal , non-triple-bonded atoms.\nFor example the following structures have no rotatable bonds:  CCC ,  CCC#CCC , and  C1CCCCC1 .\nNote: Since the  ârotatableâ property  depends on the âin ringâ property.\nthe  OEFindRingAtomsAndBonds  function must be called\nbefore accessing the  rotatable bond  property via the\n IsRotor  method of  OEQBondBase . \n \n script Â¶ scripts Â¶ Python programs are often called  scripts  because they are\nusually interpreted and not precompiled.  For most purposes,  script  and  program \nare the same in Python, and this documentation may use either term to refer to\na file of Python source code. \n \n SDF Â¶ A Structural Data File (SDF) encodes information about chemical compounds\nin plain text. It is based on the  MOL  format developed originally by Molecular\nDesign Limited (MDL).  An SDF file can encode multiple molecules in a single\nfile. The internet has considerable practical information\non the format, such as  https://lifechemicals.com/order-and-supply/how-to-work-with-sd-files . \n \n shard Â¶ Shards are thin wrappers around files (not related to Orion Files). Each shard can store up to\n5 GB of arbitrary binary data as well as\n256 kB of user defined metadata in the form of  JSON . \n \n SMARTS Â¶ SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification (SMARTS) \n SMARTS is a language that allows specifying substructures by providing\na number of primitive symbols describing atomic and bond properties.\nAtom and bond primitive specifications may be combined to form\nexpressions by using logical operators.\nAn introduction to SMARTS syntax is provided in  SMARTS Pattern Matching .\nFor more information go to  the documentation of SMARTS on the Daylight Chemical Information Systems site \n \n SMILES Â¶ Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) \n A SMILES string represents a molecule by describing only its\nmolecular graph ( i.e.  atoms and bonds in the connection table, but no chiral or\nisotopic information).\nThere are usually a large number of valid SMILES which represent a\ngiven structure.\nFor example, CCO, OCC and C(O)C all specify the structure of ethanol.\nFor generating an arbitrary SMILES string, use the\n OECreateAbsSmiString  function.\nAn introduction to SMILES syntax is provided in chapter  SMILES Line Notation .\nFor more information go to  the documentation of SMILES on the Daylight Chemical Information Systems site \n \n SMIRKS Â¶ SMILES Reaction Kernel Specification (SMIRKS) \n SMIRKS is a reaction transform language.\nA reaction considered valid according to the strict SMIRKS semantics if 1) all mapped product atoms have\ncorresponding mapped reactant atoms,\nand 2) all atom maps must be pairwise ( i.e. , every map class has exactly\none reactant and one product atom)\nThe strict semantics also requires that unmapped reactant atoms are\ndestroyed in the reaction.\nThe  strict  semantics means full compliance with SMIRKS defined by its originator, Daylight Inc.\nAn introduction to SMIRKS syntax is provided in  Reactions .\nFor more information go to  the documentation of SMIRKS on the Daylight Chemical Information Systems site \nAdditional information on the semantics of SMIRKS language can be found at\n SMIRKS Tutorial on the Daylight Chemical Information Systems site . \n \n stable API Â¶ Toolkits that have been fully developed, documented, and tested are\nconsidered stable.  The API definitions for these toolkits will be\nconsistent across languages and platforms and will not change between\ntoolkit releases.\nCode written with earlier versions of the toolkit will compile and\nrun with newer versions. This allows users to easily upgrade\nto newer versions without worrying about breaking legacy code. \n \n stereo atom Â¶ In  OEChem TK  the atom stereo information is stored as relative\npositions of neighboring atoms around a tetrahedral center.\nIf an atom has specified stereochemistry, then the\n HasStereoSpecified  method of\n OEAtomBase  returns True.\nIn  OEChem TK , atom stereochemistry is internally represented by the two properties\n stereo atom  and  chiral atom .\nThese properties are completely independent and allow\n OEChem TK  to retain configuration information about atoms that are not\nchiral atoms, or to identify chiral atoms whose configuration is not\nspecified. In the current version of  OEChem TK , the only class of\nstereochemistry supported for atoms is\n Tetrahedral , which corresponds\nto  \\(sp3\\)  tetrahedral chirality. Valid return values for\nthe  OEAtomStereo  Tetrahedral stereochemistry\nclass are  Left  and\n Right .  See also the  chiral atom  definition, the\n OEBondBase   SetStereo  method, the\n OEBondBase   GetStereo  method, the\n OEBondBase   HasStereoSpecified  method, and the\n Bond Stereochemistry  section \n \n stereo bond Â¶ In  OEChem TK  the bond stereo information is stored as relative\npositions of neighboring atoms around a bond.\nIf a bond has specified stereochemistry, then the\n HasStereoSpecified  method\nof  OEAtomBase  returns\nTrue.\nIn  OEChem TK , atom stereochemistry is internally represented by the two properties\n stereo atom  and  chiral atom .\nThese properties are completely independent and allow\n OEChem TK  to retain configuration information about atoms that are not\nchiral atoms, or to identify chiral atoms whose configuration is not\nspecified. In the current version of  OEChem TK , the only class of\nstereochemistry supported for atoms is\n Tetrahedral , which corresponds\nto  \\(sp3\\)  tetrahedral chirality. Valid return values for\nthe  OEAtomStereo  Tetrahedral stereochemistry\nclass are  Left  and\n Right .  See also the  chiral atom  definition, the\n OEBondBase   SetStereo  method, the\n OEBondBase   GetStereo  method, the\n OEBondBase   HasStereoSpecified  method, and the\n Bond Stereochemistry  section \n \n structural key Â¶ A structural key is a fixed-length bitstring in which each bit is\nassociated with a specific molecular pattern.\nWhen a structural key is generated for a molecule, the bitstring\nencodes whether or not these specific molecular patterns are\npresent or absent in the molecule.\nThe performance of such keys depends on the choice of the\nfragments used for constructing the keys and the probability of\ntheir presence in the searched molecule databases. \n \n SVG Â¶ Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a family of specifications of\nan XML-based file format for describing two-dimensional vector\ngraphics. \n \n Tanimoto Â¶ The Tanimoto coefficient (T) is a similarity measure for comparing chemical structures\nby means of molecular fingerprints. It is the ratio of the number of features common to both\ncompounds to the total number of features. Two structures are generally considered similar\nif T > 0.85. \n \n vector image Â¶ Vector graphics represent images using geometrical primitives\nsuch as points, lines, curves, and shapes or polygon(s), which\nare all based on mathematical equations. \n \n zwitterion Â¶ zwitterionic Â¶ A zwitterion contains an equal number of positively and negatively charged\nfunctional groups.

Collections, datasets, and raw data files are\naccessible here.  The data organization system implements familiar concepts of paths and folders\nto organize and access data in  Orion . \n The Programming Guide has additional technical details about data handling in Orion . \n \n Organizing and sharing data in folders Â¶ \n Users can organize the data according to the way they would like\nto share data among team members in a project. In addition, there are controlled data sharing\ncapabilities among members in the project. To achieve these objectives, the following main folders\nare available to users. \n \n My Data The data in this location are private and only\naccessible by the user. However, these data still can be shared by moving the data to a Shared\nSpace workspace. Data are put in My Data unless you specify otherwise in your upload. \n Only you can see the data until you share it to the Team or Shared folders. \n \n Team Data The data in this location are available to all project members. \n \n Shared Spaces The data in this location are available to the project members selected by the user. \n \n \n \n Orion provides automatic intraspection of files: hovering gives a depiction of the\nfirst structure if the file contains small molecules, or a protein schematic if amino acids\nare present. Selecting one or more datasets creates an active dataset. Active datasets are\ncarried forward to any feature domain (for example, moving to the Analyze page automatically\npopulates the spreadsheet). The  Project   Data  page also shows which filters are currently\napplied to the active data. \n \n Project Data Page Layout Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Add Data  button \n Allows users to add data by uploading files,  sketching , or importing a biomolecule. \n \n Search \n Allows users to search for collections, datasets, or files by name or tag. \n \n Show  drop-down \n Allows users to show any assortment of collections, datasets, and files. \n \n Sort by  drop-down \n Allows users sort by one of several options. \n \n Datasets Table \n Lists project datasets, sorted as specified by the  Sort   by:  drop-down. \n \n Trash Can \n Repository for deleted datasets. To restore the dataset, click on the Trash Can, select the dataset, and drag it to the\nappropriate folder. \n \n \n \n \n Tile View Â¶ \n Another form of intraspection is available for small molecule files: the tile view. Activate the tile view by\nclicking the   icon to the left of a dataset name.\nOn completion of the browsing of structures, click  Cancel , and you will be returned to the originating page. \n \n The tile view displays a panel list of structures in 2D or 3D, with associated\nproperties. It can be configured to display single structures, a side-by-side view, a grid compare view, or a grid view.\nEntries can be sorted by properties selected from all those available within the dataset.\nThe tile view is designed for fast traversal; selected structures can form the basis of a selected set on leaving\nthe page. \n \n \n What actions do I need to take if I had an account on a pre-2021 version of Orion? Â¶ \n If you have a pre-2021  Orion  account, you\nwill need to take some action on the shared data from previous  Orion  versions. \n \n Decide how to organize the data. \n Move all previously shared items into the appropriate folders. \n Assign collections to a project. \n \n \n AWS Representation \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can. Anything in the\nTrash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. \n In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ\noption. Please consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n \n Searching for data Â¶ \n You can search for datasets by entering a tag or resource name in the search\nbar. Select the main folder or space you would like to search. Next, enter the tag\nor resource name and click on that name. Then, the results will be shown at the bottom\nof the page. In addition, you will be able to see the path where this data can be\nfound. \n \n \n Uploading data Â¶ \n You can specify a path when uploading a file into  Orion . To specify a path,\nselect the folder or subfolders as applicable. Alternatively, you can go up a\ndirectory by clicking on the up arrow or using the backspace key.\nAlso, you can create a new subfolder by entering the name and then\nclicking on  Create   a   new   folder . \n \n CXSMILES Data Â¶ \n Data can be uploaded in CXSMILES format. (Data/My Data/+Add Data/Uploadâ¦.) \n \n \n \n Downloading and Exporting Data Â¶ \n You can download data, and it will be converted to a canonical format if necessary. \n \n Select dataset > More Actions > Export. \n In the Export pop-up, choose your preferred file format, then click Export. \n In the notification panel, you can check the status of your exports. \n After download, optionally move or delete the exported file from My Data Exports. \n \n \n \n Deleting data Â¶ \n To delete data, first select the data you want to delete\nby clicking on the square box on the left side to the folder or subfolder name.\nNext, click the   icon on the far right or in the top menu.\nMultiple data can be selected and deleted at once. Then, these data will be\nmoved to the  Trash  space. The items in the trash will be automatically deleted after\n30 days. \n \n \n Preserving Data of a Removed User Â¶ \n Customers can open a support request to remove a user from an organization, which\ntransfers ownership of that userâs data to project owners or an organization administrator. \n \n \n Subfolders Â¶ \n To create a new subfolder, first select the place\n( My   Data ,  Team   Data  or  Shared   Spaces ) where you want to create a new subfolder.\nThen, click on the   icon next to the path (example:\nMy Data). In the pop-up window, enter the\nfolder name and click  OK . A new subfolder will be created\nwith the specified name in the selected path. \n You can create a new folder or subfolder in the same window you use to\nupload data or when starting a floe run. To do this,\nselect the path and then enter the name of the\nsubfolder you want to create. A green bar\nwill appear with  Create   a   new   folder  next to the\nsubfolder name you just entered. Click on  Create   a \n new   folder . A new folder or subfolder will show up\non the path specified. \n \n Favorite subfolders Â¶ \n To quickly access a subfolder, you can mark it as a favorite by clicking\non the  star  next to the folder, and it will be added to the  Favorite   Folders  area in the left side column. \n \n \n Deleting subfolders Â¶ \n To delete a subfolder, select the subfolder you want to\ndelete and click on the   icon. The subfolder and all the contents in this\nsubfolder will be moved to the Trash space. The items in the trash will be automatically\ndeleted after 30 days. \n \n \n Moving a subfolder Â¶ \n A subfolder can be moved to another path or location. To do this, select the folder you\nwould like to move, and click either the bi-directional line icon on top or the ellipsis\nicon, and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path and click the  Move  button.\nThe subfolder (and its contents) will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n \n Video tutorial about project data Â¶ \n For more information on the use of the project data\nfacilities,  see the tutorial video . \n \n Note \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can.\nAnything in the Trash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ option.\nPlease consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n Moving data between projects Â¶ \n Data (datasets, files and collections) can be moved between projects, folders or subfolders.\nTo do this, select the data you would like to move and click the bi-directional line icon or\nthe ellipsis ( ... ) icon and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path, and click\nthe  Move  button. The selected data will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n Collection Metadata Â¶ \n Some collections feature an information icon ( ) that displays pregenerated metadata about the collection. The\ninformation may be helpful in working with collections, because you can see the metadata immediately, without having\nto run a floe. \n \n \n \n \n \n Discussion boards Â¶ \n You often need not only to share data with team members but also to discuss the results\nwith them. \n Discussion boards are accessed by the âchatâ icon ( ) on the  Project   Data  page. If you select the\nicon, you get a display on the right side of the screen that will be familiar from\nother chat experiences you have used. \n You can share links and images along with text comments, and discussions are preserved\nso you can revisit them.  The discussion board  autosaves usersâ edits. \n For an introduction, see this training video: Introducing Discussion Boards \n You can see further information in this training video: Using Discussion Boards . \n \n \n Shared spaces Â¶ \n To share data, use the  Shared   Spaces  main folder (or space). \n You can start by creating a workspace in  Shared   Spaces . Click on the  +  icon\nnext to the path. A pop-up window named  Workspace   name  will appear. Enter the\nname of the workspace you want to create and click  OK . \n A new subfolder with the\nspecified name will show in the Shared Spaces. If you click on this workspace,\nthen you will have the option to add members with whom you want to share the data. \n Click on the   icon and then click on  Edit   Users . Enter the name of the\nuser/project member you want to add. In this window, you will have the option\nto set the permissions (write, delete) you want for that user to have.  All the\ndata in this workspace will be shared with the selected users/project members. \n Alternatively, if you would like all project members to have access to the data,\nsave the data in the  Team   Data  space. \n The items ( workspaces ) in  Shared   Spaces  resemble folders, but they are actually file systems in their own right.  The user interface\nenforces the differences between workspaces and folders. \n \n Note \n With folders, access to data by others is determined by the folder you choose to use.  For example, things in the  Team   Data  folder\nare accessible to all members of the project team. For the workspaces within  Shared   Spaces , you can define a subset of users who have access to the workspace\nand its data.  You can pick the users by use of the   icon. \n \n \n Move, Drag-and-Drop The user interface does not show these actions for workspaces in the list of workspaces because they cannot be performed. \n \n Create and Rename and Delete You can perform these actions on workspaces. \n \n Inside a workspace Folders created within a workspace behave as other folders do. \n \n \n \n \n Workspace with contents Â¶ \n \n \n \n List of workspaces Â¶ \n \n \n \n Organization Data Page Â¶ \n \n \n Data available to an organization Â¶ \n \n The  Organization   Data  space allows for\nadmin users to share datasets and collections with the entire organization. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Your right to use the toolkits are governed by\nthe OpenEye license which is binding to You. \n For certain Linux distributions, GCC library components are included as object\nfiles.  Your rights to use GCC library components (libstdc++, libgcc, and\nlibgomp) included with these distributions are governed by the GPLv3 license as\nfollows: \n The components libstdc++, libgcc, and libgomp are part of GCC. \n \n GCC is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version. \n GCC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details. \n \n You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with GCC (see below).  If not, see  Licenses GNU Project  . \n Per GPLv3, section 6d, the source for GCC is available for download from the\nfollowing location:  GNU .  The GCC library components\nincluded here are from version gcc-4.9.3 and are built using the standard\ninstructions at  Installing GCC . \n \n GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION Â¶ \n Version 3.1, 31 March 2009\n\nCopyright Â© 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nThis GCC Runtime Library Exception (\"Exception\") is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License,\nversion 3 (\"GPLv3\"). It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder\nof the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with\nthe compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs\nto use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n0. Definitions.\n\nA file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process,\nor makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.\n\n\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified\nlater version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with\nGCC in accord with the license of GCC.\n\n\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable\nform or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code\ndoes not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a\ncompiler intermediate representation.\n\nThe \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written\ncode, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and\npreprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood\nas starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.\n\nA Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is\ndone without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate\nrepresentations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.\n\n1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\nYou have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules,\neven if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by\nEligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the\nlicensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by\nthe copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.\n \n \n \n See also \n \n http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception.html \n \n \n \n \n GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Â¶ \n                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                     Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                          Preamble\n\n The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\n software and other kinds of works.\n\n   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\n to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\n the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n your programs, too.\n\n   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\n know their rights.\n\n   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n authors of previous versions.\n\n   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n modification follow.\n\n                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   0. Definitions.\n\n   \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n   \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n   \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\n exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\n earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n on the Program.\n\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\n permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\n distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\n public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\n a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n   An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\n to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\n the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n   1. Source Code.\n\n   The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\n for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\n form of a work.\n\n   A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\n standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\n is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n   The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\n than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n   The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\n the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\n System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\n which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\n includes interface definition files associated with source files for\n the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\n linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\n such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\n subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n Source.\n\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\n same work.\n\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\n covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\n rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n makes it unnecessary.\n\n   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n measures.\n\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n technological measures.\n\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\n recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\n in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\n parts of the aggregate.\n\n   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\n machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\n in one of these ways:\n\n   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n   Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n   customarily used for software interchange.\n\n   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n   written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n   long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n   model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n   copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n   product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n   medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n   more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n   conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n   Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n   written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n   alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n   only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n   with subsection 6b.\n\n   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n   place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n   Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n   further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n   Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n   copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n   may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n   that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n   clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n   Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n   Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n   available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n   you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n   Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n   charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\n restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n where to find the applicable terms.\n\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n the above requirements apply either way.\n\n   8. Termination.\n\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n paragraph of section 11).\n\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\n holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n your receipt of the notice.\n\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\n material under section 10.\n\n   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\n for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n   An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\n organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\n not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n   11. Patents.\n\n   A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\n work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n   A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\n owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\n by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\n consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\n purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\n patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\n this License.\n\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\n make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\n propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\n agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\n party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n patent against the party.\n\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\n publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\n then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\n available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\n consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\n license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\n actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\n in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n work and works based on it.\n\n   A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\n the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\n work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\n in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\n to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\n covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\n the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\n combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\n License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\n but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n combination as such.\n\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\n the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n address new problems or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\n Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\n Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\n option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\n version or of any later version published by the Free Software\n Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\n GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\n by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\n public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\n to choose that version for the Program.\n\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different\n permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\n author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\n later version.\n\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\n HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\n OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\n THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\n IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\n ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\n THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\n USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\n DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\n PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\n EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\n above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\n reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\n an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\n Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\n copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n     (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n     GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\n notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\n The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\n parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\n might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\n if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\n For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\n into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\n may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\n the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\n Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n \n \n \n See also \n \n http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Collections, datasets, and raw data files are\naccessible here.  The data organization system implements familiar concepts of paths and folders\nto organize and access data in  Orion . \n The Programming Guide has additional technical details about data handling in Orion . \n \n Organizing and sharing data in folders Â¶ \n Users can organize the data according to the way they would like\nto share data among team members in a project. In addition, there are controlled data sharing\ncapabilities among members in the project. To achieve these objectives, the following main folders\nare available to users. \n \n My Data The data in this location are private and only\naccessible by the user. However, these data still can be shared by moving the data to a Shared\nSpace workspace. Data are put in My Data unless you specify otherwise in your upload. \n Only you can see the data until you share it to the Team or Shared folders. \n \n Team Data The data in this location are available to all project members. \n \n Shared Spaces The data in this location are available to the project members selected by the user. \n \n \n \n Orion provides automatic intraspection of files: hovering gives a depiction of the\nfirst structure if the file contains small molecules, or a protein schematic if amino acids\nare present. Selecting one or more datasets creates an active dataset. Active datasets are\ncarried forward to any feature domain (for example, moving to the Analyze page automatically\npopulates the spreadsheet). The  Project   Data  page also shows which filters are currently\napplied to the active data. \n \n Project Data Page Layout Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Add Data  button \n Allows users to add data by uploading files,  sketching , or importing a biomolecule. \n \n Search \n Allows users to search for collections, datasets, or files by name or tag. \n \n Show  drop-down \n Allows users to show any assortment of collections, datasets, and files. \n \n Sort by  drop-down \n Allows users sort by one of several options. \n \n Datasets Table \n Lists project datasets, sorted as specified by the  Sort   by:  drop-down. \n \n Trash Can \n Repository for deleted datasets. To restore the dataset, click on the Trash Can, select the dataset, and drag it to the\nappropriate folder. \n \n \n \n \n Tile View Â¶ \n Another form of intraspection is available for small molecule files: the tile view. Activate the tile view by\nclicking the   icon to the left of a dataset name.\nOn completion of the browsing of structures, click  Cancel , and you will be returned to the originating page. \n \n The tile view displays a panel list of structures in 2D or 3D, with associated\nproperties. It can be configured to display single structures, a side-by-side view, a grid compare view, or a grid view.\nEntries can be sorted by properties selected from all those available within the dataset.\nThe tile view is designed for fast traversal; selected structures can form the basis of a selected set on leaving\nthe page. \n \n \n What actions do I need to take if I had an account on a pre-2021 version of Orion? Â¶ \n If you have a pre-2021  Orion  account, you\nwill need to take some action on the shared data from previous  Orion  versions. \n \n Decide how to organize the data. \n Move all previously shared items into the appropriate folders. \n Assign collections to a project. \n \n \n AWS Representation \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can. Anything in the\nTrash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. \n In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ\noption. Please consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n \n Searching for data Â¶ \n You can search for datasets by entering a tag or resource name in the search\nbar. Select the main folder or space you would like to search. Next, enter the tag\nor resource name and click on that name. Then, the results will be shown at the bottom\nof the page. In addition, you will be able to see the path where this data can be\nfound. \n \n \n Uploading data Â¶ \n You can specify a path when uploading a file into  Orion . To specify a path,\nselect the folder or subfolders as applicable. Alternatively, you can go up a\ndirectory by clicking on the up arrow or using the backspace key.\nAlso, you can create a new subfolder by entering the name and then\nclicking on  Create   a   new   folder . \n \n CXSMILES Data Â¶ \n Data can be uploaded in CXSMILES format. (Data/My Data/+Add Data/Uploadâ¦.) \n \n \n \n Downloading and Exporting Data Â¶ \n You can download data, and it will be converted to a canonical format if necessary. \n \n Select dataset > More Actions > Export. \n In the Export pop-up, choose your preferred file format, then click Export. \n In the notification panel, you can check the status of your exports. \n After download, optionally move or delete the exported file from My Data Exports. \n \n \n \n Deleting data Â¶ \n To delete data, first select the data you want to delete\nby clicking on the square box on the left side to the folder or subfolder name.\nNext, click the   icon on the far right or in the top menu.\nMultiple data can be selected and deleted at once. Then, these data will be\nmoved to the  Trash  space. The items in the trash will be automatically deleted after\n30 days. \n \n \n Preserving Data of a Removed User Â¶ \n Customers can open a support request to remove a user from an organization, which\ntransfers ownership of that userâs data to project owners or an organization administrator. \n \n \n Subfolders Â¶ \n To create a new subfolder, first select the place\n( My   Data ,  Team   Data  or  Shared   Spaces ) where you want to create a new subfolder.\nThen, click on the   icon next to the path (example:\nMy Data). In the pop-up window, enter the\nfolder name and click  OK . A new subfolder will be created\nwith the specified name in the selected path. \n You can create a new folder or subfolder in the same window you use to\nupload data or when starting a floe run. To do this,\nselect the path and then enter the name of the\nsubfolder you want to create. A green bar\nwill appear with  Create   a   new   folder  next to the\nsubfolder name you just entered. Click on  Create   a \n new   folder . A new folder or subfolder will show up\non the path specified. \n \n Favorite subfolders Â¶ \n To quickly access a subfolder, you can mark it as a favorite by clicking\non the  star  next to the folder, and it will be added to the  Favorite   Folders  area in the left side column. \n \n \n Deleting subfolders Â¶ \n To delete a subfolder, select the subfolder you want to\ndelete and click on the   icon. The subfolder and all the contents in this\nsubfolder will be moved to the Trash space. The items in the trash will be automatically\ndeleted after 30 days. \n \n \n Moving a subfolder Â¶ \n A subfolder can be moved to another path or location. To do this, select the folder you\nwould like to move, and click either the bi-directional line icon on top or the ellipsis\nicon, and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path and click the  Move  button.\nThe subfolder (and its contents) will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n \n Video tutorial about project data Â¶ \n For more information on the use of the project data\nfacilities,  see the tutorial video . \n \n Note \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can.\nAnything in the Trash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ option.\nPlease consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n Moving data between projects Â¶ \n Data (datasets, files and collections) can be moved between projects, folders or subfolders.\nTo do this, select the data you would like to move and click the bi-directional line icon or\nthe ellipsis ( ... ) icon and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path, and click\nthe  Move  button. The selected data will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n Collection Metadata Â¶ \n Some collections feature an information icon ( ) that displays pregenerated metadata about the collection. The\ninformation may be helpful in working with collections, because you can see the metadata immediately, without having\nto run a floe. \n \n \n \n \n \n Discussion boards Â¶ \n You often need not only to share data with team members but also to discuss the results\nwith them. \n Discussion boards are accessed by the âchatâ icon ( ) on the  Project   Data  page. If you select the\nicon, you get a display on the right side of the screen that will be familiar from\nother chat experiences you have used. \n You can share links and images along with text comments, and discussions are preserved\nso you can revisit them.  The discussion board  autosaves usersâ edits. \n For an introduction, see this training video: Introducing Discussion Boards \n You can see further information in this training video: Using Discussion Boards . \n \n \n Shared spaces Â¶ \n To share data, use the  Shared   Spaces  main folder (or space). \n You can start by creating a workspace in  Shared   Spaces . Click on the  +  icon\nnext to the path. A pop-up window named  Workspace   name  will appear. Enter the\nname of the workspace you want to create and click  OK . \n A new subfolder with the\nspecified name will show in the Shared Spaces. If you click on this workspace,\nthen you will have the option to add members with whom you want to share the data. \n Click on the   icon and then click on  Edit   Users . Enter the name of the\nuser/project member you want to add. In this window, you will have the option\nto set the permissions (write, delete) you want for that user to have.  All the\ndata in this workspace will be shared with the selected users/project members. \n Alternatively, if you would like all project members to have access to the data,\nsave the data in the  Team   Data  space. \n The items ( workspaces ) in  Shared   Spaces  resemble folders, but they are actually file systems in their own right.  The user interface\nenforces the differences between workspaces and folders. \n \n Note \n With folders, access to data by others is determined by the folder you choose to use.  For example, things in the  Team   Data  folder\nare accessible to all members of the project team. For the workspaces within  Shared   Spaces , you can define a subset of users who have access to the workspace\nand its data.  You can pick the users by use of the   icon. \n \n \n Move, Drag-and-Drop The user interface does not show these actions for workspaces in the list of workspaces because they cannot be performed. \n \n Create and Rename and Delete You can perform these actions on workspaces. \n \n Inside a workspace Folders created within a workspace behave as other folders do. \n \n \n \n \n Workspace with contents Â¶ \n \n \n \n List of workspaces Â¶ \n \n \n \n Organization Data Page Â¶ \n \n \n Data available to an organization Â¶ \n \n The  Organization   Data  space allows for\nadmin users to share datasets and collections with the entire organization. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Categories on\ncharts can be seen by moving the mouse cursor onto different parts of the\ngraph. \n \n Current Balance Â¶ \n This displays the current estimated running balance of this  Orion  account after subtracting Total Costs and adjusting for any credits. \n \n \n Date Range Â¶ \n This allows users to select the date range for displaying Total Costs and Credits. The default date range is seven days. \n \n \n AWS Total Costs Â¶ \n The usage table shows the estimated AWS costs for the date range selected and is broken down into the following categories: \n \n AWS Cost Breakdown Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n Example Cost \n \n \n \n Adjustments \n Orion  organization admin added expense. Usually added to reconcile the actual cost versus estimated cost. \n $0.00 \n \n Jobs \n Total user job costs on EC2 compute servers. \n $724.12 \n \n Storage Costs \n Per-user and bulk storage expense. Includes storage costs for collections, datasets, files, and temporary files. \n $452.32 \n \n Total \n The sum of all expenses. \n $1,176.44 \n \n Deposits \n Orion  organization admin added funds. \n $0.00 \n \n \n \n \n \n Downloadable Cost Data Â¶ \n With an OCLI command, a user can generate a comma-separated-value (CSV) file containing a breakdown\nof cost data.  If you are a Managed Service customer, see  the documentation on the ocli cost export command .\nSaaS customers can open a support request to obtain a copy of this CSV. \n \n \n Jobs Â¶ \n The job charts are categorized by user or project. Job costs account for the majority of the EC2\n(compute servers) portion of the costs seen in the AWS Cost Breakdown. \n \n \n Ledger Entries Â¶ \n Orion  provides estimates of an organizationâs current balance and allocates costs to users and\nprojects. Even if  Orion  is not used for a period of time, a cost is incurred for stored data. \n At the end of each job,  Orion  estimates its cost and adds an entry to the\norganization ledger. \n Storage ledger entries are added periodically on a per-user basis. These\nare calculated by summing the sizes of collections, datasets, files, and other\nobjects stored in S3 on behalf of users. \n Ledger entries include  OpenEye âs markup. \n \n Ledger Entry Types Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Credit \n Admin added funds \n \n Adjustment \n Admin added expense \n \n Storage \n Per-user incremental storage expense for collections, datasets, files, and floe packages \n \n Job \n Per-job EC2 expense \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Depending on the organizationâs Orion settings, non-SSO passwords associated with the\nOrion account can be updated here. For SSO passwords, please contact your organizationâs\nadministrator for help. \n The  Projects  Tab lists projects that you do not own but that are shared with you. The\nnumber of datasets, records, and files for a project is listed here, as well as the project owner.\nFor each project, clicking the âLeave Projectâ icon under the Action column will produce a pop-up\nwindow asking for confirmation to leave the project.\nNote: After a user leaves a project, the project admin must add them again for the user to\naccess that project. \n Global settings can be found on the  Preferences  Tab. The âNotificationâ toggle filters all Orion\nnotification windows for your current project. If you want to focus on a single\nproject, this option prevents notifications for jobs in other projects. The âTaskâ toggle allows\nyou to select email notification for the completion of Orion tasks such as job completions or\nfailures. It is important to note that this email address is the one listed on the  Profile  Tab of\nOrion. All settings on the  Preferences  Tab can be reset by clicking the red\nâResetâ button. Global job cost limits can be set for both an email notification and for job\ntermination when a job reaches a specific threshold. Any cost threshold that is set for the\nglobal preferences on this page can be overwritten on the Job Form or under the  Jobs  Tab of the\nFloe page. For best practices concerning global job cost limits, contact your\norganizationâs Orion administrator or contact OpenEye customer support. \n \n Note \n It is highly recommended to set a global cost limit for the email notification. \n \n \n Caution \n If a job reaches the job cost termination limit, the job will  not  shut down cleanly, and the results may  not  be recoverable. \n \n \n \n Figure 1.  The Preferences Tab. Â¶ \n \n The  Expenses  Tab displays the total costs for each project and for storage in the past 24 hours, 7\ndays, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year. This information includes deleted project costs when\napplicable. \n The  Tokens  Tab provides information for orionclient or OCLI users. All of a userâs tokens are\nlisted here, whether they were created from this tab or through OCLI. Tokens are created by\ndefault when a profile is configured via OCLI without an existing token. Tokens can also be created by services (such as\nMMDS) on your behalf. To create a token from\nthis tab, click the âCreate Tokenâ button and proceed as directed. To copy a token, click the\nâEyeâ icon to make the token visible and then click the âClipboardâ icon, which will turn green\nwith a checkmark to indicate that the token has been copied to your clipboard. Once the token\nis copied, paste it into the OCLI Config file; it can also be used as input using \n ocli config profile --with-token \n \n \n For more information concerning tokens and how to use them, see\nthe  Orion Programming Guide  for  configuration commands  for Orion profiles and the Quick Start guide\non  authenticating with Orion . \n \n Orion Admin View Â¶ \n Users with an Admin role in Orion have the additional  Organization  Tab. From this tab,\nAdmins can make changes that affect every user within the organization. On the left, an image\nof the organizationâs logo or name can be uploaded. On the right, the name of the organization\ncan be updated. Additionally, similar to the cost thresholds described above, an Admin can set\norganization-level thresholds. These thresholds will become the default for everyone within the\norganization. However, users may still change these thresholds on a personal level (as described\nabove) or the job level (see the  Floe page ). \n \n \n Figure 2.  Tabs on the Profile Page for Admins.

Collections, datasets, and raw data files are\naccessible here.  The data organization system implements familiar concepts of paths and folders\nto organize and access data in  Orion . \n The Programming Guide has additional technical details about data handling in Orion . \n \n Organizing and sharing data in folders Â¶ \n Users can organize the data according to the way they would like\nto share data among team members in a project. In addition, there are controlled data sharing\ncapabilities among members in the project. To achieve these objectives, the following main folders\nare available to users. \n \n My Data The data in this location are private and only\naccessible by the user. However, these data still can be shared by moving the data to a Shared\nSpace workspace. Data are put in My Data unless you specify otherwise in your upload. \n Only you can see the data until you share it to the Team or Shared folders. \n \n Team Data The data in this location are available to all project members. \n \n Shared Spaces The data in this location are available to the project members selected by the user. \n \n \n \n Orion provides automatic intraspection of files: hovering gives a depiction of the\nfirst structure if the file contains small molecules, or a protein schematic if amino acids\nare present. Selecting one or more datasets creates an active dataset. Active datasets are\ncarried forward to any feature domain (for example, moving to the Analyze page automatically\npopulates the spreadsheet). The  Project   Data  page also shows which filters are currently\napplied to the active data. \n \n Project Data Page Layout Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Add Data  button \n Allows users to add data by uploading files,  sketching , or importing a biomolecule. \n \n Search \n Allows users to search for collections, datasets, or files by name or tag. \n \n Show  drop-down \n Allows users to show any assortment of collections, datasets, and files. \n \n Sort by  drop-down \n Allows users sort by one of several options. \n \n Datasets Table \n Lists project datasets, sorted as specified by the  Sort   by:  drop-down. \n \n Trash Can \n Repository for deleted datasets. To restore the dataset, click on the Trash Can, select the dataset, and drag it to the\nappropriate folder. \n \n \n \n \n Tile View Â¶ \n Another form of intraspection is available for small molecule files: the tile view. Activate the tile view by\nclicking the   icon to the left of a dataset name.\nOn completion of the browsing of structures, click  Cancel , and you will be returned to the originating page. \n \n The tile view displays a panel list of structures in 2D or 3D, with associated\nproperties. It can be configured to display single structures, a side-by-side view, a grid compare view, or a grid view.\nEntries can be sorted by properties selected from all those available within the dataset.\nThe tile view is designed for fast traversal; selected structures can form the basis of a selected set on leaving\nthe page. \n \n \n What actions do I need to take if I had an account on a pre-2021 version of Orion? Â¶ \n If you have a pre-2021  Orion  account, you\nwill need to take some action on the shared data from previous  Orion  versions. \n \n Decide how to organize the data. \n Move all previously shared items into the appropriate folders. \n Assign collections to a project. \n \n \n AWS Representation \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can. Anything in the\nTrash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. \n In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ\noption. Please consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n \n Searching for data Â¶ \n You can search for datasets by entering a tag or resource name in the search\nbar. Select the main folder or space you would like to search. Next, enter the tag\nor resource name and click on that name. Then, the results will be shown at the bottom\nof the page. In addition, you will be able to see the path where this data can be\nfound. \n \n \n Uploading data Â¶ \n You can specify a path when uploading a file into  Orion . To specify a path,\nselect the folder or subfolders as applicable. Alternatively, you can go up a\ndirectory by clicking on the up arrow or using the backspace key.\nAlso, you can create a new subfolder by entering the name and then\nclicking on  Create   a   new   folder . \n \n CXSMILES Data Â¶ \n Data can be uploaded in CXSMILES format. (Data/My Data/+Add Data/Uploadâ¦.) \n \n \n \n Downloading and Exporting Data Â¶ \n You can download data, and it will be converted to a canonical format if necessary. \n \n Select dataset > More Actions > Export. \n In the Export pop-up, choose your preferred file format, then click Export. \n In the notification panel, you can check the status of your exports. \n After download, optionally move or delete the exported file from My Data Exports. \n \n \n \n Deleting data Â¶ \n To delete data, first select the data you want to delete\nby clicking on the square box on the left side to the folder or subfolder name.\nNext, click the   icon on the far right or in the top menu.\nMultiple data can be selected and deleted at once. Then, these data will be\nmoved to the  Trash  space. The items in the trash will be automatically deleted after\n30 days. \n \n \n Preserving Data of a Removed User Â¶ \n Customers can open a support request to remove a user from an organization, which\ntransfers ownership of that userâs data to project owners or an organization administrator. \n \n \n Subfolders Â¶ \n To create a new subfolder, first select the place\n( My   Data ,  Team   Data  or  Shared   Spaces ) where you want to create a new subfolder.\nThen, click on the   icon next to the path (example:\nMy Data). In the pop-up window, enter the\nfolder name and click  OK . A new subfolder will be created\nwith the specified name in the selected path. \n You can create a new folder or subfolder in the same window you use to\nupload data or when starting a floe run. To do this,\nselect the path and then enter the name of the\nsubfolder you want to create. A green bar\nwill appear with  Create   a   new   folder  next to the\nsubfolder name you just entered. Click on  Create   a \n new   folder . A new folder or subfolder will show up\non the path specified. \n \n Favorite subfolders Â¶ \n To quickly access a subfolder, you can mark it as a favorite by clicking\non the  star  next to the folder, and it will be added to the  Favorite   Folders  area in the left side column. \n \n \n Deleting subfolders Â¶ \n To delete a subfolder, select the subfolder you want to\ndelete and click on the   icon. The subfolder and all the contents in this\nsubfolder will be moved to the Trash space. The items in the trash will be automatically\ndeleted after 30 days. \n \n \n Moving a subfolder Â¶ \n A subfolder can be moved to another path or location. To do this, select the folder you\nwould like to move, and click either the bi-directional line icon on top or the ellipsis\nicon, and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path and click the  Move  button.\nThe subfolder (and its contents) will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n \n Video tutorial about project data Â¶ \n For more information on the use of the project data\nfacilities,  see the tutorial video . \n \n Note \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can.\nAnything in the Trash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ option.\nPlease consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n Moving data between projects Â¶ \n Data (datasets, files and collections) can be moved between projects, folders or subfolders.\nTo do this, select the data you would like to move and click the bi-directional line icon or\nthe ellipsis ( ... ) icon and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path, and click\nthe  Move  button. The selected data will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n Collection Metadata Â¶ \n Some collections feature an information icon ( ) that displays pregenerated metadata about the collection. The\ninformation may be helpful in working with collections, because you can see the metadata immediately, without having\nto run a floe. \n \n \n \n \n \n Discussion boards Â¶ \n You often need not only to share data with team members but also to discuss the results\nwith them. \n Discussion boards are accessed by the âchatâ icon ( ) on the  Project   Data  page. If you select the\nicon, you get a display on the right side of the screen that will be familiar from\nother chat experiences you have used. \n You can share links and images along with text comments, and discussions are preserved\nso you can revisit them.  The discussion board  autosaves usersâ edits. \n For an introduction, see this training video: Introducing Discussion Boards \n You can see further information in this training video: Using Discussion Boards . \n \n \n Shared spaces Â¶ \n To share data, use the  Shared   Spaces  main folder (or space). \n You can start by creating a workspace in  Shared   Spaces . Click on the  +  icon\nnext to the path. A pop-up window named  Workspace   name  will appear. Enter the\nname of the workspace you want to create and click  OK . \n A new subfolder with the\nspecified name will show in the Shared Spaces. If you click on this workspace,\nthen you will have the option to add members with whom you want to share the data. \n Click on the   icon and then click on  Edit   Users . Enter the name of the\nuser/project member you want to add. In this window, you will have the option\nto set the permissions (write, delete) you want for that user to have.  All the\ndata in this workspace will be shared with the selected users/project members. \n Alternatively, if you would like all project members to have access to the data,\nsave the data in the  Team   Data  space. \n The items ( workspaces ) in  Shared   Spaces  resemble folders, but they are actually file systems in their own right.  The user interface\nenforces the differences between workspaces and folders. \n \n Note \n With folders, access to data by others is determined by the folder you choose to use.  For example, things in the  Team   Data  folder\nare accessible to all members of the project team. For the workspaces within  Shared   Spaces , you can define a subset of users who have access to the workspace\nand its data.  You can pick the users by use of the   icon. \n \n \n Move, Drag-and-Drop The user interface does not show these actions for workspaces in the list of workspaces because they cannot be performed. \n \n Create and Rename and Delete You can perform these actions on workspaces. \n \n Inside a workspace Folders created within a workspace behave as other folders do. \n \n \n \n \n Workspace with contents Â¶ \n \n \n \n List of workspaces Â¶ \n \n \n \n Organization Data Page Â¶ \n \n \n Data available to an organization Â¶ \n \n The  Organization   Data  space allows for\nadmin users to share datasets and collections with the entire organization. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

All panes can be moved, removed, resized, or duplicated.\nThere are two views: a spreadsheet view and a 3D analysis view. \n The graphing feature can represent data with five different variables, some categorical and some continuous, via the choice of\npoint shapes, size, color, and their x and y values. Scatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and violin plots are\navailable, where appropriate, for the selected data type(s). Multiple graphs can be created. Points can be selected by lasso\nor by point-and-click. Depictions of structures can be accessed for any selected points. The graph can be moved, panned,\nor reset. Scales can be changed between linear to log forms. Regression lines (with error bars) can be added. Box plots\ncontain quartile ranges and other annotations. \n \n \n Figure 1.  When a point in the plot is selected, the spreadsheet navigates to the row representing that point. You can also select a row in the spreadsheet\nand see the corresponding point identified in the plot. Â¶ \n \n \n Spreadsheet Â¶ \n The spreadsheet allows typical actions: column sorting, pinning, reordering or deleting, and\nindication of selected rows.\nPop-up views of structures are also available. The spreadsheet data can be manipulated by\na data-handling panel that allows\ncolumns to be turned on or off. It also allows for a style to be chosen for treating imprecise\ndata (for example, ranges, inequalities, multiple values). \n JSON  data fields are viewable in the spreadsheet. \n Categorical string fields can  be filtered using a âfree textâ setting. This allows\ncreation of filters that can match multiple distinct categorical values that contain a\nprovided string. \n \n \n Figure 2.  Spreadsheet cells can be copied to the system clipboard.

Categories on\ncharts can be seen by moving the mouse cursor onto different parts of the\ngraph. \n \n Current Balance Â¶ \n This displays the current estimated running balance of this  Orion  account after subtracting Total Costs and adjusting for any credits. \n \n \n Date Range Â¶ \n This allows users to select the date range for displaying Total Costs and Credits. The default date range is seven days. \n \n \n AWS Total Costs Â¶ \n The usage table shows the estimated AWS costs for the date range selected and is broken down into the following categories: \n \n AWS Cost Breakdown Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n Example Cost \n \n \n \n Adjustments \n Orion  organization admin added expense. Usually added to reconcile the actual cost versus estimated cost. \n $0.00 \n \n Jobs \n Total user job costs on EC2 compute servers. \n $724.12 \n \n Storage Costs \n Per-user and bulk storage expense. Includes storage costs for collections, datasets, files, and temporary files. \n $452.32 \n \n Total \n The sum of all expenses. \n $1,176.44 \n \n Deposits \n Orion  organization admin added funds. \n $0.00 \n \n \n \n \n \n Downloadable Cost Data Â¶ \n With an OCLI command, a user can generate a comma-separated-value (CSV) file containing a breakdown\nof cost data.  If you are a Managed Service customer, see  the documentation on the ocli cost export command .\nSaaS customers can open a support request to obtain a copy of this CSV. \n \n \n Jobs Â¶ \n The job charts are categorized by user or project. Job costs account for the majority of the EC2\n(compute servers) portion of the costs seen in the AWS Cost Breakdown. \n \n \n Ledger Entries Â¶ \n Orion  provides estimates of an organizationâs current balance and allocates costs to users and\nprojects. Even if  Orion  is not used for a period of time, a cost is incurred for stored data. \n At the end of each job,  Orion  estimates its cost and adds an entry to the\norganization ledger. \n Storage ledger entries are added periodically on a per-user basis. These\nare calculated by summing the sizes of collections, datasets, files, and other\nobjects stored in S3 on behalf of users. \n Ledger entries include  OpenEye âs markup. \n \n Ledger Entry Types Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Credit \n Admin added funds \n \n Adjustment \n Admin added expense \n \n Storage \n Per-user incremental storage expense for collections, datasets, files, and floe packages \n \n Job \n Per-job EC2 expense \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Orion can be accessed either directly through\nthe customerâs relationship with AWS or indirectly through  OpenEye . \n Orion is an open platform that allows for straightforward integration of third-party code (i.e., from customers, academics, and vendors). The Orion\nfront end is a webpage, deliverable on any internet-enabled supported platform. \n \n Supported Browsers Â¶ \n \n \n Orion supports the most recent stable desktop versions of MozillaÂ® FirefoxÂ® and Google Chromeâ¢. \n \n \n \n Hint \n Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), Microsoft Edge, and macOS Safari are not supported. \n \n \n \n Supported Platforms Â¶ \n \n \n Windows \n macOS \n Linux \n Chrome OS \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n \n Orion organization admins can view user spending by project and user. \n Orion organization admins can see all projects and jobs from all users. \n Orion organization admins can only see project names but not the data in the projects. \n Non-admins can only see their own projects and the projects shared with them. \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n \n On Orionâs home page, users can view information about: \n \n \n projects \n recent jobs \n system status \n expenses \n RSS feeds \n A new userâs default project is created when the new user is added to the system. \n Non-admin usersâ projects are listed on an admin userâs Home page. \n Duplicate project names are not allowed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n \n Each project has its own Summary page. From the Project Summary page, users can: \n \n \n edit or delete projects \n add notes, molecular structures, and files \n add or remove project members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n \n Usersâ datasets, collections, and files are displayed on the Project data page. \n Files can be uploaded to the  Project   Data  page and converted to datasets, while datasets can be downloaded in the usual molecular formats. \n Admin users can share files and datasets with the entire organization. \n Collections can be filtered by name. \n Datasets can be copied and/or duplicated. \n Users can share multiple datasets to a project or with multiple recipients in one operation. \n Users can add or remove data tags. \n Datasets can be viewed using Card View. \n Columns are sortable in Card View. \n Individual molecules can be selected from the Card View to send to a Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n \n The Analyze pageâs features include: \n \n \n a molecular spreadsheet \n graphing capabilitiesâscatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and violin plots \n 2D and 3D viewing \n molecule subset creation \n filtering and tagging \n cheminformatics functionsâsubstructure search, R-group decomposition, and property calculation \n \n \n \n Molecules can be sent directly to FastROCS from the Analyze page. \n Molecules can be sent directly to a Floe using the Send to Workfloe feature. \n Users can add comments and ratings for molecules in the Analyze page and the 3D Viewer. \n Conformer data can be displayed in the spreadsheet and plot. \n Receptors are by default designated as â3D Onlyâ datasets, to keep them out of property calculations and the Analyze page. \n Users can turn on binning on a per-column basis. \n \n \n \n \n Floe UI Â¶ \n \n \n Users can upload packages containing Cubes and Floes. \n Packages can be searched by name. \n Floes can be shared with other users. \n The Floe Editor allows users to build a new Floe or edit an existing Floe. \n Users can place Cubes in a Cube group. \n Cube groups can be deleted. \n Running jobs can be monitored graphically. \n Jobs can be filtered by project and user (admin-only functionality). \n Parameters can be marked as âhiddenâ by the Floe author. \n Initializer ports are colored blue to make them visually different from other port types. \n Archive files (i.e., tar and zip files) are importable. \n \n \n \n \n 3D Viewer Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer includes functionality for perceiving protein and ligand interactions as well as for editing facilities for ligands in the context of the active site. \n Users can convert molecules from 2D to 3D in the 3D Viewer. \n Keyboard navigation can be used to cycle through conformers. \n Users can send molecules from MMDS directly to the 3D Viewer. \n Surfaces can be Z-clipped independently of other 3D objects. \n \n \n \n \n Iterative Design Â¶ \n \n \n Iterative Design has functionality that allows users to generate new analogs of existing compounds. Users can edit molecules in 2D or 3D. Additionally, users can\nchoose from the following algorithms: \n \n \n Matched Molecular Pairs (MMP) \n Near Fragment Replacement (NPR) \n Reagent Join (RJ) \n Explore Sidechains (ES) \n \n \n \n Iterative Design and molecule builder tasks run on their own servers. \n Property plots handle multiple pages of data. \n If necessary, entry into an Iterative Design session can be cancelled by the user. \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n \n Two data services are available: \n \n \n MacroMolecular Data Service (MMDS), a protein structure repository \n FastROCS, a method for retrieving all similar structures by shape and color (aligned chemical groups) from a database \n \n \n \n Users can send molecules directly to Orion from either data service. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

You can find links\nto them in this section and in relevant places elsewhere in this manual.  For a list of all tutorial videos,\nsee  Orion Video Tutorials . \n \n Data organization video Â¶ \n The features for organizing data have been revamped significantly.  For an introduction, try\nthis video:\n Data Organization in Orion . \n \n \n Discussion board videos Â¶ \n Discussion boards are a new user interface feature introduced in this version, accessed\nvia an icon on the  Project   Data  page:\n Introducing Discussion Boards \n We welcome your feedback on discussion boards after you have used them:\n Using Discussion Boards . \n For more about discussion boards, see  Discussion boards . \n \n \n 3D modeling videos Â¶ \n There are new badge and list features on the  3D   Modeling  page.\nHere is an introduction:  Badges and Lists in Orion . \n There are several more new videos about 3D modeling at  Orion Video Tutorials . \n \n \n \n Highlights Â¶ \n \n \n This release introduces a revamped  Project   Data  page which now uses a path- and folder-based file system for data organization. \n A desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders, or launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections as part of data migration. \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the  Home  page when users first login to Orion. \n Many enhancements have been made to  3D   Modeling  page, including several new tools for protein editing. \n Molecules, proteins, and other components of a dataset can now be identified using badges. \n Tooltips in the  3D   Viewer  have been enhanced. \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n A new discussion board Beta  feature is now available. \n This release introduces Orion stack protection through rate-limiting. \n Job cost email alerts can now be created. \n A dedicated  Organization   Data  project has been added. The data in this project are available to all Organization users and are prepopulated with\nOpenEye Data such as Collections used for virtual screening. \n New Floes have been added to  Floe  packages including: \n \n \n Non-Equilibrium Switching (NES) Floes in the MD Floe package. \n Cluster Poses, FastROCS,  and FreeForm Pose Floes in the Large-Scale-Floes package. \n Large-Scale Reaction Enumeration Floes in the Generative Design Floe package. \n \n \n \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types. \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Orion stack protection through rate-limiting has been implemented. \n Job cost email alerts are now available. Organization admins can set Job cost limits alerts for the entire organization on the Profile page. In addition, users can set\nJob cost limits alerts and Job termination thresholds for their own jobs on the Profile page. Job cost alerts can also be set prior to running a job on the Job Form.\nThese cost thresholds can be updated while a Job is running on the Job Status page. \n This release introduces a new Discussion Board Beta . Saved discussions may contain notes, images, or snapshot links of the 3D Modeling or Analyze pages.\nDiscussions are accessible to all team members. \n Substructure searching is now accessible from the databar filters. This functionality was previously available only on the Analyze page. \n Cubes which are being throttled now show up with special coloring. \n More information has been added to Job Debugging Data. \n A new instance-draining state has been added, which allows jobs to continue running but prevents new jobs from using the instance. \n Dataset writing is now more robust with field names of different types.\nFor new data being written to a dataset, it will be cast/coerced/promoted to the type of the existing dataset field. This matches what drconvert does.\nWhen writing records, if an incompatible type of data for a given field name is seen, the writer generates a new alternate field and stores the data in\nan alternate field rather than failing the writing process. \n \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A âWhatâs Newâ dialog is now displayed on the Home page when users first login to Orion. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n A dedicated Organization Data project has been added. Data in this project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. In addition, the\nOrganization Data project is pre-populated with OpenEye-supplied data such as the Brood database, OpenEye-prepared third-party vendor collections for virtual screening,\ntutorial datasets, and other data that can be used as input to some of the included Orion Floes.  Note : The Organization Data project is only visible to Organization\nadmins in the list of projects in the Navbar and Home page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Organization admins now have control over the listing of projects on the Home page and Navbar on the Project Summary page. Organization admins can now toggle between\nâShow Allâ Organization projects and âShow Ownâ projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The Project Data page has been overhauled and now uses a folder-based file system for organizing your data, instead of a flat view. \n Within a project, data are organized into three main areas: \n \n \n My Data â your private data. No other users have access to this data. \n Team Data â data that are available to all project members. \n Shared Spaces â data that are available to select project members, i.e. shared data among the selected project members. \n \n \n \n New folders can be created from the Project Data page, when uploading data, and when launching a Floe from the Job Form. \n A dedicated Organization Data project is available to everyone in the Organization and is located above the Project Data folder hierarchy. Data in\nthis project is visible to all Organization users and can be accessed from any project. \n The path to a desired data location can be specified when uploading data, creating subfolders or when launching a Floe on the Job Form. \n Folders and subfolders can be added to the  Favorite   Folders  space for quick and easy access. \n Data are now shared by creating a workspace in the âShared Foldersâ main folder. Permissions can be set for each user added to the workspace. \n Drag and drop functionality allows users to move collections, datasets, and/or files to the three main data areas, Trash can or other subfolders. \n String Search will search within the current folder or all project folders, i.e.,  My Data,  Team Data or Shared Spaces. \n Discussion boards Beta  can be created within a workspace to highlight and annotate data within that workspace, and can be viewed by all of that workspaceâs members. \n As part of the data migration, users will be prompted to triage shared data and collections. Collections now belong to projects. \n \n \n \n \n \n 3D Modeling Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer list is now record-focused. \n Badges to identify molecules, proteins and other components of datasets have been added to the 3D Viewer list. \n Tools for protein editing, including protonation state modification, capping terminal residues, and residue mutation have been added. \n When mutating protein residues, multiple residues can be selected and users can walk through applying a mutation to each residue in the selected set. \n Most of the small molecule editing tools can now be applied to proteins as well. \n The 3D molecule editor now contains the same set of molecular fragment templates as the 2D sketcher. \n An edited protein can be saved as a new dataset. \n A new receptor in OEDesignUnit (DU) display has been added. \n OEDesignUnit components can be edited and saved in place. \n Receptor ligands can be edited but not in place. Users need to make a copy of the ligand before editing.  Note : Receptor proteins cannot be edited. \n More options to save edited small molecules are now available. \n Users can edit datasets they donât own in place but need to save them to new datasets. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\n Project   Data  page. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to the small molecule editing tools. \n Depiction tooltips in the list appear more reliably. \n \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Improvements have been made to Data Handling. Users can now set the visibility for each column for each component of the user interface from the Data Handling dialog. \n A Discusson board Beta  was added for collaboration and replaces Saved Views. Saved Discusson boards can be retrieved from the Discussion menu on the\nProject Data page. \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Spreadsheet fields now render correctly when users scroll to the right side of the spreadsheet. \n Layout issues when using multiple plots in trellis mode have been fixed. \n Molecules can now be sent to a Floe that takes a molecule fragment as input, for example, the Brood Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Selecting conformer points in the Scatter plot no longer fails intermittently. \n Saved color settings now persist. \n \n \n \n \n \n Floe User Interface Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n Support for grouping promoted parameters has been added to the Job Form. \n Support for a Job output folder path has been added to the Job Form. The default folder for Job output is âMy Dataâ, however, users can select\na different folder or create a new one. \n Job Cost alert and termination thresholds can now be set on the Job Form. The default values are inherited from the âMy Job Cost Limitsâ set\non the usersâ Profile page. Job Cost thresholds for any given job can be disabled by clearing the current value or setting the value to zero.\nThe values of these thresholds can be adjusted on the Job Status page after a job has been launched. \n Cubes in a running job are now colored specially when they are being throttled. More details are available in the Floe help. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Major Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n A bug has been fixed that caused Job parameters for jobs launched from the Orion command line interface (OCLI) from being displayed on the Job Status page. \n A bug that prevented the Job Form from opening for certain Floes has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Minor Bug Fixes Â¶ \n \n \n Jobs Page: \n \n \n An issue that sometimes caused duplicate input or output parameters to appear in the Job Form has been fixed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Minor internal improvements have been made to  FastROCS ,  MaaS , and  MMDS . \n \n \n \n \n \n Admin Mode Â¶ \n \n New Features Â¶ \n \n \n Options to customize Job Cost email alerts for Organization admins have been added. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Collections, datasets, and raw data files are\naccessible here.  The data organization system implements familiar concepts of paths and folders\nto organize and access data in  Orion . \n The Programming Guide has additional technical details about data handling in Orion . \n \n Organizing and sharing data in folders Â¶ \n Users can organize the data according to the way they would like\nto share data among team members in a project. In addition, there are controlled data sharing\ncapabilities among members in the project. To achieve these objectives, the following main folders\nare available to users. \n \n My Data The data in this location are private and only\naccessible by the user. However, these data still can be shared by moving the data to a Shared\nSpace workspace. Data are put in My Data unless you specify otherwise in your upload. \n Only you can see the data until you share it to the Team or Shared folders. \n \n Team Data The data in this location are available to all project members. \n \n Shared Spaces The data in this location are available to the project members selected by the user. \n \n \n \n Orion provides automatic intraspection of files: hovering gives a depiction of the\nfirst structure if the file contains small molecules, or a protein schematic if amino acids\nare present. Selecting one or more datasets creates an active dataset. Active datasets are\ncarried forward to any feature domain (for example, moving to the Analyze page automatically\npopulates the spreadsheet). The  Project   Data  page also shows which filters are currently\napplied to the active data. \n \n Project Data Page Layout Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Add Data  button \n Allows users to add data by uploading files,  sketching , or importing a biomolecule. \n \n Search \n Allows users to search for collections, datasets, or files by name or tag. \n \n Show  drop-down \n Allows users to show any assortment of collections, datasets, and files. \n \n Sort by  drop-down \n Allows users sort by one of several options. \n \n Datasets Table \n Lists project datasets, sorted as specified by the  Sort   by:  drop-down. \n \n Trash Can \n Repository for deleted datasets. To restore the dataset, click on the Trash Can, select the dataset, and drag it to the\nappropriate folder. \n \n \n \n \n Tile View Â¶ \n Another form of intraspection is available for small molecule files: the tile view. Activate the tile view by\nclicking the   icon to the left of a dataset name.\nOn completion of the browsing of structures, click  Cancel , and you will be returned to the originating page. \n \n The tile view displays a panel list of structures in 2D or 3D, with associated\nproperties. It can be configured to display single structures, a side-by-side view, a grid compare view, or a grid view.\nEntries can be sorted by properties selected from all those available within the dataset.\nThe tile view is designed for fast traversal; selected structures can form the basis of a selected set on leaving\nthe page. \n \n \n What actions do I need to take if I had an account on a pre-2021 version of Orion? Â¶ \n If you have a pre-2021  Orion  account, you\nwill need to take some action on the shared data from previous  Orion  versions. \n \n Decide how to organize the data. \n Move all previously shared items into the appropriate folders. \n Assign collections to a project. \n \n \n AWS Representation \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can. Anything in the\nTrash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. \n In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ\noption. Please consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n \n Searching for data Â¶ \n You can search for datasets by entering a tag or resource name in the search\nbar. Select the main folder or space you would like to search. Next, enter the tag\nor resource name and click on that name. Then, the results will be shown at the bottom\nof the page. In addition, you will be able to see the path where this data can be\nfound. \n \n \n Uploading data Â¶ \n You can specify a path when uploading a file into  Orion . To specify a path,\nselect the folder or subfolders as applicable. Alternatively, you can go up a\ndirectory by clicking on the up arrow or using the backspace key.\nAlso, you can create a new subfolder by entering the name and then\nclicking on  Create   a   new   folder . \n \n CXSMILES Data Â¶ \n Data can be uploaded in CXSMILES format. (Data/My Data/+Add Data/Uploadâ¦.) \n \n \n \n Downloading and Exporting Data Â¶ \n You can download data, and it will be converted to a canonical format if necessary. \n \n Select dataset > More Actions > Export. \n In the Export pop-up, choose your preferred file format, then click Export. \n In the notification panel, you can check the status of your exports. \n After download, optionally move or delete the exported file from My Data Exports. \n \n \n \n Deleting data Â¶ \n To delete data, first select the data you want to delete\nby clicking on the square box on the left side to the folder or subfolder name.\nNext, click the   icon on the far right or in the top menu.\nMultiple data can be selected and deleted at once. Then, these data will be\nmoved to the  Trash  space. The items in the trash will be automatically deleted after\n30 days. \n \n \n Preserving Data of a Removed User Â¶ \n Customers can open a support request to remove a user from an organization, which\ntransfers ownership of that userâs data to project owners or an organization administrator. \n \n \n Subfolders Â¶ \n To create a new subfolder, first select the place\n( My   Data ,  Team   Data  or  Shared   Spaces ) where you want to create a new subfolder.\nThen, click on the   icon next to the path (example:\nMy Data). In the pop-up window, enter the\nfolder name and click  OK . A new subfolder will be created\nwith the specified name in the selected path. \n You can create a new folder or subfolder in the same window you use to\nupload data or when starting a floe run. To do this,\nselect the path and then enter the name of the\nsubfolder you want to create. A green bar\nwill appear with  Create   a   new   folder  next to the\nsubfolder name you just entered. Click on  Create   a \n new   folder . A new folder or subfolder will show up\non the path specified. \n \n Favorite subfolders Â¶ \n To quickly access a subfolder, you can mark it as a favorite by clicking\non the  star  next to the folder, and it will be added to the  Favorite   Folders  area in the left side column. \n \n \n Deleting subfolders Â¶ \n To delete a subfolder, select the subfolder you want to\ndelete and click on the   icon. The subfolder and all the contents in this\nsubfolder will be moved to the Trash space. The items in the trash will be automatically\ndeleted after 30 days. \n \n \n Moving a subfolder Â¶ \n A subfolder can be moved to another path or location. To do this, select the folder you\nwould like to move, and click either the bi-directional line icon on top or the ellipsis\nicon, and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path and click the  Move  button.\nThe subfolder (and its contents) will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n \n Video tutorial about project data Â¶ \n For more information on the use of the project data\nfacilities,  see the tutorial video . \n \n Note \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can.\nAnything in the Trash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ option.\nPlease consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n Moving data between projects Â¶ \n Data (datasets, files and collections) can be moved between projects, folders or subfolders.\nTo do this, select the data you would like to move and click the bi-directional line icon or\nthe ellipsis ( ... ) icon and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path, and click\nthe  Move  button. The selected data will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n Collection Metadata Â¶ \n Some collections feature an information icon ( ) that displays pregenerated metadata about the collection. The\ninformation may be helpful in working with collections, because you can see the metadata immediately, without having\nto run a floe. \n \n \n \n \n \n Discussion boards Â¶ \n You often need not only to share data with team members but also to discuss the results\nwith them. \n Discussion boards are accessed by the âchatâ icon ( ) on the  Project   Data  page. If you select the\nicon, you get a display on the right side of the screen that will be familiar from\nother chat experiences you have used. \n You can share links and images along with text comments, and discussions are preserved\nso you can revisit them.  The discussion board  autosaves usersâ edits. \n For an introduction, see this training video: Introducing Discussion Boards \n You can see further information in this training video: Using Discussion Boards . \n \n \n Shared spaces Â¶ \n To share data, use the  Shared   Spaces  main folder (or space). \n You can start by creating a workspace in  Shared   Spaces . Click on the  +  icon\nnext to the path. A pop-up window named  Workspace   name  will appear. Enter the\nname of the workspace you want to create and click  OK . \n A new subfolder with the\nspecified name will show in the Shared Spaces. If you click on this workspace,\nthen you will have the option to add members with whom you want to share the data. \n Click on the   icon and then click on  Edit   Users . Enter the name of the\nuser/project member you want to add. In this window, you will have the option\nto set the permissions (write, delete) you want for that user to have.  All the\ndata in this workspace will be shared with the selected users/project members. \n Alternatively, if you would like all project members to have access to the data,\nsave the data in the  Team   Data  space. \n The items ( workspaces ) in  Shared   Spaces  resemble folders, but they are actually file systems in their own right.  The user interface\nenforces the differences between workspaces and folders. \n \n Note \n With folders, access to data by others is determined by the folder you choose to use.  For example, things in the  Team   Data  folder\nare accessible to all members of the project team. For the workspaces within  Shared   Spaces , you can define a subset of users who have access to the workspace\nand its data.  You can pick the users by use of the   icon. \n \n \n Move, Drag-and-Drop The user interface does not show these actions for workspaces in the list of workspaces because they cannot be performed. \n \n Create and Rename and Delete You can perform these actions on workspaces. \n \n Inside a workspace Folders created within a workspace behave as other folders do. \n \n \n \n \n Workspace with contents Â¶ \n \n \n \n List of workspaces Â¶ \n \n \n \n Organization Data Page Â¶ \n \n \n Data available to an organization Â¶ \n \n The  Organization   Data  space allows for\nadmin users to share datasets and collections with the entire organization. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Orion can be accessed either directly through\nthe customerâs relationship with AWS or indirectly through  OpenEye . \n Orion is an open platform that allows for straightforward integration of third-party code (i.e., from customers, academics, and vendors). The Orion\nfront end is a webpage, deliverable on any internet-enabled supported platform. \n \n Supported Browsers Â¶ \n \n \n Orion supports the most recent stable desktop versions of MozillaÂ® FirefoxÂ® and Google Chromeâ¢. \n \n \n \n Hint \n Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), Microsoft Edge, and macOS Safari are not supported. \n \n \n \n Supported Platforms Â¶ \n \n \n Windows \n macOS \n Linux \n Chrome OS \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n \n Orion organization admins can view user spending by project and user. \n Orion organization admins can see all projects and jobs from all users. \n Orion organization admins can only see project names but not the data in the projects. \n Non-admins can only see their own projects and the projects shared with them. \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n \n On Orionâs home page, users can view information about: \n \n \n projects \n recent jobs \n system status \n expenses \n RSS feeds \n A new userâs default project is created when the new user is added to the system. \n Non-admin usersâ projects are listed on an admin userâs Home page. \n Duplicate project names are not allowed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n \n Each project has its own Summary page. From the Project Summary page, users can: \n \n \n edit or delete projects \n add notes, molecular structures, and files \n add or remove project members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n \n Usersâ datasets, collections, and files are displayed on the Project data page. \n Files can be uploaded to the  Project   Data  page and converted to datasets, while datasets can be downloaded in the usual molecular formats. \n Admin users can share files and datasets with the entire organization. \n Collections can be filtered by name. \n Datasets can be copied and/or duplicated. \n Users can share multiple datasets to a project or with multiple recipients in one operation. \n Users can add or remove data tags. \n Datasets can be viewed using Card View. \n Columns are sortable in Card View. \n Individual molecules can be selected from the Card View to send to a Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n \n The Analyze pageâs features include: \n \n \n a molecular spreadsheet \n graphing capabilitiesâscatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and violin plots \n 2D and 3D viewing \n molecule subset creation \n filtering and tagging \n cheminformatics functionsâsubstructure search, R-group decomposition, and property calculation \n \n \n \n Molecules can be sent directly to FastROCS from the Analyze page. \n Molecules can be sent directly to a Floe using the Send to Workfloe feature. \n Users can add comments and ratings for molecules in the Analyze page and the 3D Viewer. \n Conformer data can be displayed in the spreadsheet and plot. \n Receptors are by default designated as â3D Onlyâ datasets, to keep them out of property calculations and the Analyze page. \n Users can turn on binning on a per-column basis. \n \n \n \n \n Floe UI Â¶ \n \n \n Users can upload packages containing Cubes and Floes. \n Packages can be searched by name. \n Floes can be shared with other users. \n The Floe Editor allows users to build a new Floe or edit an existing Floe. \n Users can place Cubes in a Cube group. \n Cube groups can be deleted. \n Running jobs can be monitored graphically. \n Jobs can be filtered by project and user (admin-only functionality). \n Parameters can be marked as âhiddenâ by the Floe author. \n Initializer ports are colored blue to make them visually different from other port types. \n Archive files (i.e., tar and zip files) are importable. \n \n \n \n \n 3D Viewer Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer includes functionality for perceiving protein and ligand interactions as well as for editing facilities for ligands in the context of the active site. \n Users can convert molecules from 2D to 3D in the 3D Viewer. \n Keyboard navigation can be used to cycle through conformers. \n Users can send molecules from MMDS directly to the 3D Viewer. \n Surfaces can be Z-clipped independently of other 3D objects. \n \n \n \n \n Iterative Design Â¶ \n \n \n Iterative Design has functionality that allows users to generate new analogs of existing compounds. Users can edit molecules in 2D or 3D. Additionally, users can\nchoose from the following algorithms: \n \n \n Matched Molecular Pairs (MMP) \n Near Fragment Replacement (NPR) \n Reagent Join (RJ) \n Explore Sidechains (ES) \n \n \n \n Iterative Design and molecule builder tasks run on their own servers. \n Property plots handle multiple pages of data. \n If necessary, entry into an Iterative Design session can be cancelled by the user. \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n \n Two data services are available: \n \n \n MacroMolecular Data Service (MMDS), a protein structure repository \n FastROCS, a method for retrieving all similar structures by shape and color (aligned chemical groups) from a database \n \n \n \n Users can send molecules directly to Orion from either data service. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Orion can be accessed either directly through\nthe customerâs relationship with AWS or indirectly through  OpenEye . \n Orion is an open platform that allows for straightforward integration of third-party code (i.e., from customers, academics, and vendors). The Orion\nfront end is a webpage, deliverable on any internet-enabled supported platform. \n \n Supported Browsers Â¶ \n \n \n Orion supports the most recent stable desktop versions of MozillaÂ® FirefoxÂ® and Google Chromeâ¢. \n \n \n \n Hint \n Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), Microsoft Edge, and macOS Safari are not supported. \n \n \n \n Supported Platforms Â¶ \n \n \n Windows \n macOS \n Linux \n Chrome OS \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n \n Orion organization admins can view user spending by project and user. \n Orion organization admins can see all projects and jobs from all users. \n Orion organization admins can only see project names but not the data in the projects. \n Non-admins can only see their own projects and the projects shared with them. \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n \n On Orionâs home page, users can view information about: \n \n \n projects \n recent jobs \n system status \n expenses \n RSS feeds \n A new userâs default project is created when the new user is added to the system. \n Non-admin usersâ projects are listed on an admin userâs Home page. \n Duplicate project names are not allowed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n \n Each project has its own Summary page. From the Project Summary page, users can: \n \n \n edit or delete projects \n add notes, molecular structures, and files \n add or remove project members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n \n Usersâ datasets, collections, and files are displayed on the Project data page. \n Files can be uploaded to the  Project   Data  page and converted to datasets, while datasets can be downloaded in the usual molecular formats. \n Admin users can share files and datasets with the entire organization. \n Collections can be filtered by name. \n Datasets can be copied and/or duplicated. \n Users can share multiple datasets to a project or with multiple recipients in one operation. \n Users can add or remove data tags. \n Datasets can be viewed using Card View. \n Columns are sortable in Card View. \n Individual molecules can be selected from the Card View to send to a Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n \n The Analyze pageâs features include: \n \n \n a molecular spreadsheet \n graphing capabilitiesâscatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and violin plots \n 2D and 3D viewing \n molecule subset creation \n filtering and tagging \n cheminformatics functionsâsubstructure search, R-group decomposition, and property calculation \n \n \n \n Molecules can be sent directly to FastROCS from the Analyze page. \n Molecules can be sent directly to a Floe using the Send to Workfloe feature. \n Users can add comments and ratings for molecules in the Analyze page and the 3D Viewer. \n Conformer data can be displayed in the spreadsheet and plot. \n Receptors are by default designated as â3D Onlyâ datasets, to keep them out of property calculations and the Analyze page. \n Users can turn on binning on a per-column basis. \n \n \n \n \n Floe UI Â¶ \n \n \n Users can upload packages containing Cubes and Floes. \n Packages can be searched by name. \n Floes can be shared with other users. \n The Floe Editor allows users to build a new Floe or edit an existing Floe. \n Users can place Cubes in a Cube group. \n Cube groups can be deleted. \n Running jobs can be monitored graphically. \n Jobs can be filtered by project and user (admin-only functionality). \n Parameters can be marked as âhiddenâ by the Floe author. \n Initializer ports are colored blue to make them visually different from other port types. \n Archive files (i.e., tar and zip files) are importable. \n \n \n \n \n 3D Viewer Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer includes functionality for perceiving protein and ligand interactions as well as for editing facilities for ligands in the context of the active site. \n Users can convert molecules from 2D to 3D in the 3D Viewer. \n Keyboard navigation can be used to cycle through conformers. \n Users can send molecules from MMDS directly to the 3D Viewer. \n Surfaces can be Z-clipped independently of other 3D objects. \n \n \n \n \n Iterative Design Â¶ \n \n \n Iterative Design has functionality that allows users to generate new analogs of existing compounds. Users can edit molecules in 2D or 3D. Additionally, users can\nchoose from the following algorithms: \n \n \n Matched Molecular Pairs (MMP) \n Near Fragment Replacement (NPR) \n Reagent Join (RJ) \n Explore Sidechains (ES) \n \n \n \n Iterative Design and molecule builder tasks run on their own servers. \n Property plots handle multiple pages of data. \n If necessary, entry into an Iterative Design session can be cancelled by the user. \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n \n Two data services are available: \n \n \n MacroMolecular Data Service (MMDS), a protein structure repository \n FastROCS, a method for retrieving all similar structures by shape and color (aligned chemical groups) from a database \n \n \n \n Users can send molecules directly to Orion from either data service. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Collections, datasets, and raw data files are\naccessible here.  The data organization system implements familiar concepts of paths and folders\nto organize and access data in  Orion . \n The Programming Guide has additional technical details about data handling in Orion . \n \n Organizing and sharing data in folders Â¶ \n Users can organize the data according to the way they would like\nto share data among team members in a project. In addition, there are controlled data sharing\ncapabilities among members in the project. To achieve these objectives, the following main folders\nare available to users. \n \n My Data The data in this location are private and only\naccessible by the user. However, these data still can be shared by moving the data to a Shared\nSpace workspace. Data are put in My Data unless you specify otherwise in your upload. \n Only you can see the data until you share it to the Team or Shared folders. \n \n Team Data The data in this location are available to all project members. \n \n Shared Spaces The data in this location are available to the project members selected by the user. \n \n \n \n Orion provides automatic intraspection of files: hovering gives a depiction of the\nfirst structure if the file contains small molecules, or a protein schematic if amino acids\nare present. Selecting one or more datasets creates an active dataset. Active datasets are\ncarried forward to any feature domain (for example, moving to the Analyze page automatically\npopulates the spreadsheet). The  Project   Data  page also shows which filters are currently\napplied to the active data. \n \n Project Data Page Layout Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Add Data  button \n Allows users to add data by uploading files,  sketching , or importing a biomolecule. \n \n Search \n Allows users to search for collections, datasets, or files by name or tag. \n \n Show  drop-down \n Allows users to show any assortment of collections, datasets, and files. \n \n Sort by  drop-down \n Allows users sort by one of several options. \n \n Datasets Table \n Lists project datasets, sorted as specified by the  Sort   by:  drop-down. \n \n Trash Can \n Repository for deleted datasets. To restore the dataset, click on the Trash Can, select the dataset, and drag it to the\nappropriate folder. \n \n \n \n \n Tile View Â¶ \n Another form of intraspection is available for small molecule files: the tile view. Activate the tile view by\nclicking the   icon to the left of a dataset name.\nOn completion of the browsing of structures, click  Cancel , and you will be returned to the originating page. \n \n The tile view displays a panel list of structures in 2D or 3D, with associated\nproperties. It can be configured to display single structures, a side-by-side view, a grid compare view, or a grid view.\nEntries can be sorted by properties selected from all those available within the dataset.\nThe tile view is designed for fast traversal; selected structures can form the basis of a selected set on leaving\nthe page. \n \n \n What actions do I need to take if I had an account on a pre-2021 version of Orion? Â¶ \n If you have a pre-2021  Orion  account, you\nwill need to take some action on the shared data from previous  Orion  versions. \n \n Decide how to organize the data. \n Move all previously shared items into the appropriate folders. \n Assign collections to a project. \n \n \n AWS Representation \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can. Anything in the\nTrash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. \n In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ\noption. Please consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n \n Searching for data Â¶ \n You can search for datasets by entering a tag or resource name in the search\nbar. Select the main folder or space you would like to search. Next, enter the tag\nor resource name and click on that name. Then, the results will be shown at the bottom\nof the page. In addition, you will be able to see the path where this data can be\nfound. \n \n \n Uploading data Â¶ \n You can specify a path when uploading a file into  Orion . To specify a path,\nselect the folder or subfolders as applicable. Alternatively, you can go up a\ndirectory by clicking on the up arrow or using the backspace key.\nAlso, you can create a new subfolder by entering the name and then\nclicking on  Create   a   new   folder . \n \n CXSMILES Data Â¶ \n Data can be uploaded in CXSMILES format. (Data/My Data/+Add Data/Uploadâ¦.) \n \n \n \n Downloading and Exporting Data Â¶ \n You can download data, and it will be converted to a canonical format if necessary. \n \n Select dataset > More Actions > Export. \n In the Export pop-up, choose your preferred file format, then click Export. \n In the notification panel, you can check the status of your exports. \n After download, optionally move or delete the exported file from My Data Exports. \n \n \n \n Deleting data Â¶ \n To delete data, first select the data you want to delete\nby clicking on the square box on the left side to the folder or subfolder name.\nNext, click the   icon on the far right or in the top menu.\nMultiple data can be selected and deleted at once. Then, these data will be\nmoved to the  Trash  space. The items in the trash will be automatically deleted after\n30 days. \n \n \n Preserving Data of a Removed User Â¶ \n Customers can open a support request to remove a user from an organization, which\ntransfers ownership of that userâs data to project owners or an organization administrator. \n \n \n Subfolders Â¶ \n To create a new subfolder, first select the place\n( My   Data ,  Team   Data  or  Shared   Spaces ) where you want to create a new subfolder.\nThen, click on the   icon next to the path (example:\nMy Data). In the pop-up window, enter the\nfolder name and click  OK . A new subfolder will be created\nwith the specified name in the selected path. \n You can create a new folder or subfolder in the same window you use to\nupload data or when starting a floe run. To do this,\nselect the path and then enter the name of the\nsubfolder you want to create. A green bar\nwill appear with  Create   a   new   folder  next to the\nsubfolder name you just entered. Click on  Create   a \n new   folder . A new folder or subfolder will show up\non the path specified. \n \n Favorite subfolders Â¶ \n To quickly access a subfolder, you can mark it as a favorite by clicking\non the  star  next to the folder, and it will be added to the  Favorite   Folders  area in the left side column. \n \n \n Deleting subfolders Â¶ \n To delete a subfolder, select the subfolder you want to\ndelete and click on the   icon. The subfolder and all the contents in this\nsubfolder will be moved to the Trash space. The items in the trash will be automatically\ndeleted after 30 days. \n \n \n Moving a subfolder Â¶ \n A subfolder can be moved to another path or location. To do this, select the folder you\nwould like to move, and click either the bi-directional line icon on top or the ellipsis\nicon, and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path and click the  Move  button.\nThe subfolder (and its contents) will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n \n Video tutorial about project data Â¶ \n For more information on the use of the project data\nfacilities,  see the tutorial video . \n \n Note \n Datasets are stored within an AWS Postgres database. Files and collections are stored on AWS S3.\nIf datasets, files, or collections are deleted, they are sent to the Trash Can.\nAnything in the Trash Can is deleted automatically after 30 days. In addition, users can delete items in the Trash Can immediately by selecting the âDelete permanentlyâ option.\nPlease consult the Orion Admin Guide for further details. \n \n \n \n Moving data between projects Â¶ \n Data (datasets, files and collections) can be moved between projects, folders or subfolders.\nTo do this, select the data you would like to move and click the bi-directional line icon or\nthe ellipsis ( ... ) icon and select  Move . Then, choose the destination or path, and click\nthe  Move  button. The selected data will be moved to the specified destination or path. \n \n Note \n Multiple datasets can be moved at once. \n \n \n \n Collection Metadata Â¶ \n Some collections feature an information icon ( ) that displays pregenerated metadata about the collection. The\ninformation may be helpful in working with collections, because you can see the metadata immediately, without having\nto run a floe. \n \n \n \n \n \n Discussion boards Â¶ \n You often need not only to share data with team members but also to discuss the results\nwith them. \n Discussion boards are accessed by the âchatâ icon ( ) on the  Project   Data  page. If you select the\nicon, you get a display on the right side of the screen that will be familiar from\nother chat experiences you have used. \n You can share links and images along with text comments, and discussions are preserved\nso you can revisit them.  The discussion board  autosaves usersâ edits. \n For an introduction, see this training video: Introducing Discussion Boards \n You can see further information in this training video: Using Discussion Boards . \n \n \n Shared spaces Â¶ \n To share data, use the  Shared   Spaces  main folder (or space). \n You can start by creating a workspace in  Shared   Spaces . Click on the  +  icon\nnext to the path. A pop-up window named  Workspace   name  will appear. Enter the\nname of the workspace you want to create and click  OK . \n A new subfolder with the\nspecified name will show in the Shared Spaces. If you click on this workspace,\nthen you will have the option to add members with whom you want to share the data. \n Click on the   icon and then click on  Edit   Users . Enter the name of the\nuser/project member you want to add. In this window, you will have the option\nto set the permissions (write, delete) you want for that user to have.  All the\ndata in this workspace will be shared with the selected users/project members. \n Alternatively, if you would like all project members to have access to the data,\nsave the data in the  Team   Data  space. \n The items ( workspaces ) in  Shared   Spaces  resemble folders, but they are actually file systems in their own right.  The user interface\nenforces the differences between workspaces and folders. \n \n Note \n With folders, access to data by others is determined by the folder you choose to use.  For example, things in the  Team   Data  folder\nare accessible to all members of the project team. For the workspaces within  Shared   Spaces , you can define a subset of users who have access to the workspace\nand its data.  You can pick the users by use of the   icon. \n \n \n Move, Drag-and-Drop The user interface does not show these actions for workspaces in the list of workspaces because they cannot be performed. \n \n Create and Rename and Delete You can perform these actions on workspaces. \n \n Inside a workspace Folders created within a workspace behave as other folders do. \n \n \n \n \n Workspace with contents Â¶ \n \n \n \n List of workspaces Â¶ \n \n \n \n Organization Data Page Â¶ \n \n \n Data available to an organization Â¶ \n \n The  Organization   Data  space allows for\nadmin users to share datasets and collections with the entire organization. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Orion can be accessed either directly through\nthe customerâs relationship with AWS or indirectly through  OpenEye . \n Orion is an open platform that allows for straightforward integration of third-party code (i.e., from customers, academics, and vendors). The Orion\nfront end is a webpage, deliverable on any internet-enabled supported platform. \n \n Supported Browsers Â¶ \n \n \n Orion supports the most recent stable desktop versions of MozillaÂ® FirefoxÂ® and Google Chromeâ¢. \n \n \n \n Hint \n Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), Microsoft Edge, and macOS Safari are not supported. \n \n \n \n Supported Platforms Â¶ \n \n \n Windows \n macOS \n Linux \n Chrome OS \n \n \n \n \n General Â¶ \n \n \n Orion organization admins can view user spending by project and user. \n Orion organization admins can see all projects and jobs from all users. \n Orion organization admins can only see project names but not the data in the projects. \n Non-admins can only see their own projects and the projects shared with them. \n \n \n \n \n Home Â¶ \n \n \n On Orionâs home page, users can view information about: \n \n \n projects \n recent jobs \n system status \n expenses \n RSS feeds \n A new userâs default project is created when the new user is added to the system. \n Non-admin usersâ projects are listed on an admin userâs Home page. \n Duplicate project names are not allowed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Summary Â¶ \n \n \n Each project has its own Summary page. From the Project Summary page, users can: \n \n \n edit or delete projects \n add notes, molecular structures, and files \n add or remove project members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Project Data Â¶ \n \n \n Usersâ datasets, collections, and files are displayed on the Project data page. \n Files can be uploaded to the  Project   Data  page and converted to datasets, while datasets can be downloaded in the usual molecular formats. \n Admin users can share files and datasets with the entire organization. \n Collections can be filtered by name. \n Datasets can be copied and/or duplicated. \n Users can share multiple datasets to a project or with multiple recipients in one operation. \n Users can add or remove data tags. \n Datasets can be viewed using Card View. \n Columns are sortable in Card View. \n Individual molecules can be selected from the Card View to send to a Floe. \n \n \n \n \n Analyze Â¶ \n \n \n The Analyze pageâs features include: \n \n \n a molecular spreadsheet \n graphing capabilitiesâscatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, and violin plots \n 2D and 3D viewing \n molecule subset creation \n filtering and tagging \n cheminformatics functionsâsubstructure search, R-group decomposition, and property calculation \n \n \n \n Molecules can be sent directly to FastROCS from the Analyze page. \n Molecules can be sent directly to a Floe using the Send to Workfloe feature. \n Users can add comments and ratings for molecules in the Analyze page and the 3D Viewer. \n Conformer data can be displayed in the spreadsheet and plot. \n Receptors are by default designated as â3D Onlyâ datasets, to keep them out of property calculations and the Analyze page. \n Users can turn on binning on a per-column basis. \n \n \n \n \n Floe UI Â¶ \n \n \n Users can upload packages containing Cubes and Floes. \n Packages can be searched by name. \n Floes can be shared with other users. \n The Floe Editor allows users to build a new Floe or edit an existing Floe. \n Users can place Cubes in a Cube group. \n Cube groups can be deleted. \n Running jobs can be monitored graphically. \n Jobs can be filtered by project and user (admin-only functionality). \n Parameters can be marked as âhiddenâ by the Floe author. \n Initializer ports are colored blue to make them visually different from other port types. \n Archive files (i.e., tar and zip files) are importable. \n \n \n \n \n 3D Viewer Â¶ \n \n \n The 3D Viewer includes functionality for perceiving protein and ligand interactions as well as for editing facilities for ligands in the context of the active site. \n Users can convert molecules from 2D to 3D in the 3D Viewer. \n Keyboard navigation can be used to cycle through conformers. \n Users can send molecules from MMDS directly to the 3D Viewer. \n Surfaces can be Z-clipped independently of other 3D objects. \n \n \n \n \n Iterative Design Â¶ \n \n \n Iterative Design has functionality that allows users to generate new analogs of existing compounds. Users can edit molecules in 2D or 3D. Additionally, users can\nchoose from the following algorithms: \n \n \n Matched Molecular Pairs (MMP) \n Near Fragment Replacement (NPR) \n Reagent Join (RJ) \n Explore Sidechains (ES) \n \n \n \n Iterative Design and molecule builder tasks run on their own servers. \n Property plots handle multiple pages of data. \n If necessary, entry into an Iterative Design session can be cancelled by the user. \n \n \n \n \n Data Sources Â¶ \n \n \n Two data services are available: \n \n \n MacroMolecular Data Service (MMDS), a protein structure repository \n FastROCS, a method for retrieving all similar structures by shape and color (aligned chemical groups) from a database \n \n \n \n Users can send molecules directly to Orion from either data service. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

Categories on\ncharts can be seen by moving the mouse cursor onto different parts of the\ngraph. \n \n Current Balance Â¶ \n This displays the current estimated running balance of this  Orion  account after subtracting Total Costs and adjusting for any credits. \n \n \n Date Range Â¶ \n This allows users to select the date range for displaying Total Costs and Credits. The default date range is seven days. \n \n \n AWS Total Costs Â¶ \n The usage table shows the estimated AWS costs for the date range selected and is broken down into the following categories: \n \n AWS Cost Breakdown Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n Example Cost \n \n \n \n Adjustments \n Orion  organization admin added expense. Usually added to reconcile the actual cost versus estimated cost. \n $0.00 \n \n Jobs \n Total user job costs on EC2 compute servers. \n $724.12 \n \n Storage Costs \n Per-user and bulk storage expense. Includes storage costs for collections, datasets, files, and temporary files. \n $452.32 \n \n Total \n The sum of all expenses. \n $1,176.44 \n \n Deposits \n Orion  organization admin added funds. \n $0.00 \n \n \n \n \n \n Downloadable Cost Data Â¶ \n With an OCLI command, a user can generate a comma-separated-value (CSV) file containing a breakdown\nof cost data.  If you are a Managed Service customer, see  the documentation on the ocli cost export command .\nSaaS customers can open a support request to obtain a copy of this CSV. \n \n \n Jobs Â¶ \n The job charts are categorized by user or project. Job costs account for the majority of the EC2\n(compute servers) portion of the costs seen in the AWS Cost Breakdown. \n \n \n Ledger Entries Â¶ \n Orion  provides estimates of an organizationâs current balance and allocates costs to users and\nprojects. Even if  Orion  is not used for a period of time, a cost is incurred for stored data. \n At the end of each job,  Orion  estimates its cost and adds an entry to the\norganization ledger. \n Storage ledger entries are added periodically on a per-user basis. These\nare calculated by summing the sizes of collections, datasets, files, and other\nobjects stored in S3 on behalf of users. \n Ledger entries include  OpenEye âs markup. \n \n Ledger Entry Types Â¶ \n \n \n \n \n \n Name \n Description \n \n \n \n Credit \n Admin added funds \n \n Adjustment \n Admin added expense \n \n Storage \n Per-user incremental storage expense for collections, datasets, files, and floe packages \n \n Job \n Per-job EC2 expense \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Next  \n  Previous \n \n \n \n \n        © Copyright 2024, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\n      Last updated on Jul 30, 2024.\n\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"
